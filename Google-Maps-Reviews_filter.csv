The takeaway container was greasy and clearly had not been wiped or cleaned before packing.

The food quality was equally unsatisfactory. The chicken came in one large, uncut chunk, and the noodles were overcooked to the point of being mushy. For a brand like Haidilao, I expected much better quality control and packaging standards.

Hot pot restaurant ,FALSE,FALSE,tan gladdys,11,1128,2,"一直是海底捞的老顾客，以前在新加坡多家分店用餐都很愉快。但 2025 年 8 月 在该分店的免费美甲服务，却是我最失望的一次体验。

📌 等待时间过长
周末明确写明不提供卸甲服务、平均每人 35 分钟，但我等了近 3 小时，其中一个号码卡了 2 小时，最后才被告知前面有人在卸甲。规则与执行明显不一致。

📌 手法粗鲁+态度欠佳
轮到我时，先是被电话催促，结果到场后美甲师本人不在位，还等了十多分钟。期间不耐烦地拒绝我参考墙上的款式，明明说不用剪短指甲，仍被剪到拇指完全没有游离白边，影响日常。上色过程催促频繁、照灯时间不足，涂到皮肤上也不处理。

📌 公共区域体验不佳
用餐时查看 iPad，黑制服员工直接从我手中拿走并操作，没有任何说明或征询。

✅ 唯一亮点
内场粉色制服小姐姐非常贴心，服务细致，交接清楚。

我已将完整情况电邮至海底捞客服并提供所需信息，希望品牌能以专业与负责的态度认真处理 但至今仍未收到任何回复。

真是对品牌方的处理深感失望。

-当天的美甲师叫candy
-粉色衣服的内场人员是 娜娜跟sin wei","I've been a regular Haidilao customer and have enjoyed dining at several branches in Singapore. However, the free manicure at this branch in August 2025 was my most disappointing experience.

📌 Excessive Waiting Time
It's clearly stated on weekends that nail polish removal is not available and the average waiting time is 35 minutes per person, but I waited for nearly three hours. One number was stuck for two hours before I was finally informed that someone else was removing their nails. There's a clear inconsistency between the rules and enforcement.

📌 Rude Techniques + Poor Attitude
When it was my turn, I was first rushed by phone. The manicurist wasn't there when I arrived, so I waited for over ten minutes. During this time, they impatiently refused to let me refer to the designs on the wall. They clearly told me not to cut my nails short, but they still cut my thumb to the point where there was no free white edge, which disrupted my daily routine. The coloring process was frequently rushed, the lighting was insufficient, and the paint didn't get cleaned up after it was applied to my skin.

📌 Poor experience in the public areas

While checking my iPad during a meal, a black-uniformed employee took it from me and began using it without any explanation or consultation.

✅ The only positive point

The pink-uniformed women in the backroom were very attentive, providing meticulous service and a clear handover.

I have emailed Haidilao customer service with the full details and provided the requested information, hoping the brand will handle this professionally and responsibly. However, I have yet to receive a response.

I am deeply disappointed with the brand's handling of this situation.

-The manicurist that day was named Candy
-The pink-uniformed backroom staff were Nana and Sin Wei.",Haidilao,4.7,en

I am so disappointed in writing this. We have been eating from them for so long, years, probably more than 5 years. However, today is the last time me and my family is going to eat from them.
Situation: there was a short hair found in the noodles, high chance from the man preparing as people preparing food do not wear hair net/mask.
How they chose to handle this unpleasant situation: blaming us for not telling them earlier by saying “you did not give me this earlier?”
As if we chose to put the hair inside? At the same time, we only chose to tell them after finding it, were we supposed to stir the noodle and look if there was any hair from the beginning??? This was so unreasonable? They chose to bring us a plate of jus plain noodles and insincerely say “give you give you”
We just left the “compensated” noodles on the table, we do not want to accept it anymore. I do not think we are being unreasonable in any way, but told them out of good will.
Food: the noodles tasted uncooked, really distasteful.

Their Basil pork minced rice is exceptional. One of the best I've had

My gf tried their Beef noodle soup and it was good too.

They don't leave the condiments at each table and that is a downer. Hence, I needed to ask for them at the counter making it difficult to get the right amount of sauces for the right taste

Will be even better if they just leave the condiment box at each table

Price wise it is good especially if you take their lunch set

Normally Basil pork rice already and the Thai Green tea cost $11.20

But if you take the set, it is only $9.90 and comes with red ruby desert (pre inclusion of GST)

They only extra charge is GST and does not have service charge 👍

The tiramisu was available, so I gave it a try. Presentation was nice, but it turned out to be overly sweet and lacked the rich, balanced flavors you'd expect from a good tiramisu. Both the coffee and dessert leaned too heavily on sugar, which overshadowed the finer details.

You have to try their side dish- brussel sprouts- it was crunchy with a light sweet sauce that went well with it. No bitterness.

I didn’t expect the mixed grill came exactly like in menu photo- a rather large stone platform. It was good for photos lolll! But some may find it difficult to eat from it- but there is nothing you can’t resolve if you ask for a side plate.

We had 3 mains, a lychee drink and a hot tea. The bill came up to about $100 plus. Joining Collin’s as member is free- all you have to do is to download their app and get your account set up. I enrolled as a new member and got 5% off straight away and the final damaged was about $98 👍🏻

=======================
Incident date/time: 07/06/25, 825am
Jurong Spring CC

It was hari raya morning. We wanted to buy some breakfast at McD before heading home.
Little did we realise this will mean a 1 hour wait!

After making the order on the machine, we waited to be duly called. But we waited and waited. It was not even unusually crowded.
We even asked after waiting 30 mins.
Then, had to wait even further.

And when eventually given our food, we went to our car, only to find out about things missing!
Then, have to go back.
To add-on, it was not immediate yet again.
Had to wait another extended time!

Side-point: this missing-things issue is becoming common among McD happening too often.
How come mistakes are always made in YOUR favor?
How come there's never a mistake of having extra fries or burger? ONLY missing ones?
Is this really a mistake or deliberately done each time?

This whole thing is so unbecoming of any decent business in Singapore.

Firstly, why so long when the crowd is not so much?
Ok fine, maybe you have other orders or such hidden issues.

Why was there no way to inform the customers about 1 hr waiting time, so that we can make an informed decision?
This is normal procedure even a hawker centre uncle will practice.
Don't we have better things to do especially on a festive day?

2nd visit from 2 years: rating dropped to 2 stars 🌟 🌟
Weekday Lunch set consists of main (rice /ramen), simple side dish of kimchi and pickles and a drink. 3 of us ordered 3 different style of ramen(spicy chicken shin ramen, dry tossed black bean sauce ramen & kalgulsu noodle soup topped with stirred fried pork slices). The korean chicken wings qas also drenched with weird tasting sauce and not fragrant at all! Frankly very disappointed that food execution has dropped, the pork slices on the kalgulsu was tasteless, both the ramen was not well flavoured in fact cold too, and the kimchi and pickles was slimy and not fresh. 3 persons still have to pay $53 for such food fare worse than foodcourt and not satisfacting at all.

After returning from my trip to JB, I visited this outlet at 4.30pm together with my luggage and backpack. I was very tired and hungry at that time and wanted to sit at a table with a back cushion.

So I requested for such table but the manager did not allow it as she said it was meant for 3-4 people. I wanted to order many items as well but the fire plate was so small and because the seats that me and my girlfriend were assigned to had leathers all torn and tattered, we asked once again if we could move to the bigger table. The manager reluctantly allowed us to move to the other table in the end.

As we were thankful for being able to dine at the bigger table, we wanted to order more items. However, just when we were about to eat our food, the manager came over and told us we have only 50mins to finish the food and leave the table.

At this point of time, I was wondering why this was necessary as our dining hours did not have that many customers. On top of this, she kept staring at our table unhappily while we were having the meal.

I wanted to just relax and enjoy the food together with my girlfriend after returning from a trip but thanks to the 50mins of dining time limit as well as the constant stares, we could not enjoy the food to the fullest. I had high expectations of this outlet as I saw a high google rating but this experience left me thinking that it was the worst dining experience this year. Thank you so much for ruining my day, and what a way to end off my weekend! This was my mistake of entering this outlet and ultimately I would not recommend this place to anyone :)",,Yakiniku Like (Westgate),4.8,

Soup Restaurant is a household name by now, having outlets at mega malls such as NEX and Vivocity. What's interesting is that Tea House caters for us Hong Kongers who loves a good dim sum lunch.

The food didn't disappoint. An interesting Samsui Ginger Bao uses their signature 姜蓉 with minced chicken becomes our favourite bao.

I'm not used to eating the Samsui Chicken with the lettuce wrap but I'll take it. My mum knows I can wipe clean the 姜蓉 she makes at home.

We really need to eat the lychee prawn ball that is sitting in the freezer for a year now.

Apparently originating from Malaysia, the ingredients are first stir fried in a wok under high heat before adding the porridge base. When done correctly, the wok hei aroma permeates throughout the porridge, adding an extra dimension to a dish that for many represents the epitome of comfort food.

My favorite example of this porridge however doesn't even make it to Google's list of fried porridge in Singapore (again, you get plenty of porridge that isn't actually fried). Add to that, WSL is located in an industrial area not easily accessible by public transport (the nearest MRT being Joo Koon which is a 15 min walk away).

You don't have to worry about eating cold porridge here. The thick flavorful porridge is served piping hot in a claypot that takes a long while to cool down. Even at $6 it still represents fair value given how generous they were with ingredients. They keystone of this dish however,  is the wok hei and it's front and centre in WSL's porridge.

What makes it special is the wok hei – that smoky, charred aroma that lingers with every bite, proof that the chef knows how to work the fire. It’s the kind of dish you crave on a rainy evening. On the other hand, the milky fish soup is hearty in a different way. The broth is creamy yet light, with a natural sweetness that blends beautifully with the fresh, firm slices of fish. It warms you up instantly, offering comfort without being cloying.

The conveyor belt had barely 15 types of dishes, including desserts, and nothing new was replenished even after 30 minutes. The service was subpar, leaving me frustrated. When I spoke to the cashier, she cited poor business as the reason for the limited options. I was shocked – shouldn't they increase variety to attract customers? Popular items like chilled prawns and amaebi prawns were noticeably absent. I'm extremely disappointed and won't be returning.

Granted, it was simply noodles in broth with some minced meat, but I was really impressed by the flavourful broth and the perfectly cooked noodles. I actually think it's better than some budget restaurant offerings. The Sheng Jian Bao, while good, didn't justify the long wait. It has a good size, decent dough and were very juicy.

We ordered a few dishes and unfortunately, the experience was quite disappointing. The fried ee mian was particularly bad — the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didn’t work for me at all.

We also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss — once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.

Nevertheless, the receipts ended up with 10% service charge.  As it is CNY, we did not dispute with the restaurant and made payment on that day.  It was after this that i checked on the CNY Menu we ordered and noted that there is indication that there is no service charge and the only ""+"" should only be the prevailing GST of 9%.

I what's app the restaurant and request for a refund of this 10% over charge.  Was immediately answered with a call from the restaurant.  The in charge highlighted that the 10% charged was not service charge but surcharge for CNY and claim that she had spoken to me before.  I do not recall this communication instead highlighted to her that the menu sent to me clearly indicated that there is only prevailing GST on top of the CNY menu cost and clearly states that there is no service charge nor CNY surcharge mentioned.

If the dinner has been good for this dinner, we do not mind to take this as a tip to the team and not asked for this refund.  However, the reunion dinner was delayed from 730pm to 830pm and by the time ended was closed to 11pm.  My dad (elderly) was left with hungry stomach and food served around 9pm were not freshly prepared with some dishes already turning cold and not well heated.  My family's young children were cranky due to the long wait.

Such service do not deserve any service charges nor surcharge.  If only, the surcharge was clearly communicated in the menu, we may have picked another restaurant instead of this.  Thus, this is clearly a mis-interpretation of their cost.

I tried speaking to their so-call boss, but sadly he said he can't do anything.  However, when i ask why this is not indicated clearly in the menu, he mentioned that this is their usual charge and that there is a notice on that day of the dinner which placed outside the door.  Isn't this not ethnical as customers are probably only aware when they are there.

Decided to order cream sauce pasta with chicken cutlet and chicken chop which are both SGD$6.90 each.

To my suprise, the cream sauce pasta is pretty good, similar to Hot Tomato's carbonara pasta with more garlic taste yumz 😋😋 Chicken cutlet not much a comment but okay... Will prefer more flavour in it.

Chicken chop a bit rather small piece for the price wise but what's stands out is their brown sauce which is more to a sweeter side! 🤩🤩 Surprisingly, the sauce is not that salty definitely surprise me. (Yes literally love the sauce too much that I never leave a single drip of it 😅) Fries are shoe string fries okay not bad. Coleslaw seems to be handmade and definitely very yummy too!

Price is alright but portion can be bigger esp for chicken portion. Will order cream pasta again on my next visit!

Just hope that it still remain the same good quality food standard 🙏🏻",,Sahira's 175 Western (JC's Delights),5,

Anyway to my surprise the food tasted pretty decent. I would recommend their seafood dishes since the seafood is fresh and they prepare it pretty well. However I wouldn't recommend their stir fry or poultry dishes since it was average to below average in my opinion. Their dim sum dishes is alright, it wasn't bad but definitely not mind blowing.

My family decided to book this place for Chinese new year celebration and overall I would say it was a pretty good experience. The lobster dish was fresh and flavourful, the abalone was pretty huge (compared to some restaurants which give you a minute size) and not too chewy. The alaskan king crab was also well prepared and fresh, it was also nice of them to de shell a huge part of the crab which makes consumption of the meat convenient. The stir fried noodles and veggie dishes however we're just pretty normal

Staff were unresponsive and ignored our repeated requests for updates. One tofu dish wasn’t even keyed into the system—we only realized this 1.5 hours in. Boiled prawns and noodles took over 30 minutes to arrive after multiple chasing.

Two elderly guests over 80 were left waiting with almost nothing to eat. The kitchen seemed chaotic but hardly any dishes were coming out, which made it even more frustrating. Despite clearly being overwhelmed, the restaurant continued taking a la carte orders and didn’t once apologize.

Seafood restaurant ,FALSE,TRUE,MH Tham,328,265,5,"“Fantastic” wasn’t the word I expected to associate with this restaurant when I first heard about it. So, when my family decided to dine here for Chinese New Year’s Eve, our initial amusement was more about the funky decor than the food.

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find a private car park right outside. The wait staff greeted us warmly, cheerful and sincere despite the relatively quiet crowd. This was a refreshing change, especially during the festive season, when some places have waitstaff with expressions so sour like mandarin oranges that they would be considered inauspicious for a celebration.

Service was seamless. Food arrived almost immediately, and the staff thoughtfully checked in on our tea preferences. We kicked off with an authentic and well-seasoned Lo Hei, and throughout the meal, the pacing was never rushed nor slow.

Then came the real surprise, which was the food. Dish after dish impressed us, with seafood that was fresh, high quality, and generously portioned. A special mention would be the fruit garnishes. Most restaurants use stale or tasteless fruit purely for aesthetics, but here, they were fresh, juicy, and actually edible.

Our favourites were the excellent lobster cold dish and vegetable platter, but the highlight was the Mao Tai Alaskan King Crab. The liquor eliminated any fishiness while enhancing the crab’s natural sweetness and springy texture, being flavorful but never overpowering.

Portions were beyond generous. We left both full and satisfied, with plenty of leftovers, which is an auspicious touch to end a festive meal.

Restaurant ,FALSE,TRUE,Soo Hin Yeoh,1025,803,5,"Located on Level 7 of Momentus Hotel Alexandra in Queenstown, the Verandah Rooftop Rotisserie has two distinctive venues ; (1) a restaurant offering semi-buffet lunch and dinner, firewood‑oven pizzas, premium roasts, and a la carte dishes, all surrounded by lush greenery and stunning skyline views; (2) a beautiful bar with rooftop infinity pool paired with a unique swim‑up bar and floating trays, serving cocktails, wines, beers, and bar bites with panoramic views of the Southern Ridges and￼ The Interlace condominium.

We find the pizzas very good but our steak was rather ‘mini’. Hokkien Mee is really good with 3 large tiger prawns and siew yoke.The bar serves a great selection of draught beers including pale ales and IPAs for $15++ a pint.🍻

The cabbage with soft doufu soup is ok, soup is milky white but tastes like ‘technic’ , maybe they cooked with clams.

When asked, staff reluctantly stated that only one pack could be given, which I felt was a disappointing gesture—especially coming from a reputable and growing brand.

Additionally, this outlet was not as open or transparent about the birthday month promotion compared to other branches we’ve visited.

The Iberiko pork dish was the highlight. Tender slices of pork stir-fried with a heap of fragrant green chillies — spicy, savoury, and incredibly addictive. It had that signature Hunan kick without going overboard. Paired with rice, it was the kind of dish that keeps you going back for just one more bite.

The century egg with green chilli was a refreshing surprise. A cold dish, packed with heat and flavour from the chopped green chillies, garlic, and vinegar. It balanced out the richness of the pork nicely and was perfect as a starter or side.

I love the food here. It is homely and cooked very well. I am glad that they open so many stores throughout Singapore.

So I am appalled when I go to JP on my weekly dinner here that the service from the new staffs are strange, intrusive and totally unprofessional.

I ordered 4 dishes for 2 pax.

I was checked 7 times on whether my food was here.
Initially it was a normal check.
Then I noticed that these 2 ladies with  lack of things to do due to it being a weekday keep walking around just to check whether the food is here for each and every table.
They take turns to “parade” the ground and took the order list off the table, taking their time to look through the list and ask is all your food here?

On the 5th time the elderly lady check, I already told them all the food is here and she crossed out the list. I placed the list on the inner side of the table thinking to prevent them from further disturbing my dinner.

On the 6th time they walk again and check I  told her that all the food is here again. I am getting quite unhappy at this moment.

The 7th time they checked (another lady) she insisted she wants to see the order chart, when I again told her all the food is here ,she insists to have the order chart again to cross out all the food again.

These 2 staff are just going through Brownian motion, just doing the ONE thing that they are told to do repeatedly without thought or care for the process, the customers.

With all the checks on the order list, my refillable tea however was left unrefilled.

Where has all the service gone ?

The manager ( tall male staff ) tried to do service recovery despite being very busy himself. He need to go serve another table  the century egg dish etc. I am thankful for his efforts.

These new staff should still be asssigned things to do that are within their capabilities. If not they just go around disturbing all the diners and still thinking that they are doing a good job at that.

Vegetarian stall is quite good with variety. I think this is a new stall. They have a lot of varieties unlike in the past with little choice.  A bit bland for the bee hoon but with curry is fine.  Green chillies are fresh and crisp.

I tried to bear with the kopi stall for many months already. I normally order drinks via their Koufu app. I don't know why they simply don't acknowledge order from app. Many times i got to go to the counter and tell them my number, they then prepare my drink. This morning was worst, kenna ignore by the order taker. Super sian - spoil my mood

Jan - Jun 2025 :
Tried the Japanese stall.  Curry rice is good. Mashed potatoes was rich.  Portion was quite big.  Their saba was too oily, looks like deep fried. We don't like it.

Tried the braised duck kway chap.  Cannot make it.

Western food Chicken steak is good too. Pepper sauce is average. I enjoyed their mashed potatoes. I don't want the salad and stall attendant replaced with french fries for me.  Thank you. That is very thoughtful.  So far all other stalls i went to won't replace any item at all.

Zichar - lala white bee hoon average. Hor fun and sweet & sour pork ok, curry fish head is good. They have some promotional items.  Will try other dishes next time.

Thai food stall - chicken with basil : pretty good.  Next time maybe I can ask to have a bit more sauce.. hahaha.

Soup stall - cannot resist their pig stomach soup with pumpkin rice.  Satisfactory!!  Enjoyed it very much especially on rainy day!

Cleaner tables - thanks to the cleaners uncle and aunties!!

Nov 2024 :
Tried the  noodles from China Town. The duck meat is tender, unlike some stalls having tough chunky meat. The noodles is the kind that I like, without the alkaline taste!!

Oct 2024 update :
2 new stalls open. Good for us!!
I tried both this week.
New roast meat stall has plenty of choices. I tried their roast pork, roast duck and cha siew with plain rice. They do have chicken rice available, just need to inform the seller.
I like their roast pork and roast duck, but not cha siew as it is too fat and texture is like belly pork, too much oil.
Plus plus point is they use good quality rice which cook just right. Not grainy like many stalls. Thumbs up.
Have yet to try the noodles or kway teow in near future!

Welcome the soup stall !  I tried the white pepper pig stomach with ginkgo nut. Soup is peppery enough and pig stomach is soft but not chewy.  Will be back to try other soup!

Ban mian / Mee hoon kuey and sliced & fried fish noodles were disappointing. The dough for fried fish was thick. Soup was tasteless. In addition - mee hoon kuey was not fully cooked.

Today i came back for mala which i have not eaten for the last few months.  It used to be shiok.  Today's sauce was diluted and tasteless. Perhaps they changed the chef and mala sauce too.

I also had the aburi chirashi don, which wasn’t too bad either. It’s hard to tell if the fish is truly fresh since the aburi torching masks a lot of it, but the overall taste was pleasant enough — though like the pork, it does feel pretty heavy towards the end.

第一我注册了会员，然后没给我任何会员价，还让我注册会员拿会员价却没给我会员价！我朋友在这边附近上班所以给了10％，难道这样就可以不给会员价？
第二我进门就说了是2位，单上也写了是2位，我点菜米饭只点了一碗米饭，然后一个经理跑来问我是不是2位，我一直重复强调是2位，但那个黑衣经理不相信我是2位，说要帮我把另一套餐具收走，我都点了两杯水！一个人要点两杯水吗？完全不相信我是两位！态度特别特别差，不开玩笑
第三在买单时，等了非常久，买单一直出错，错了处理了又错，一直要人来协助，然后好像在那边争吵推卸来推卸去，让我与朋友一直在那边等，体验很差很不专业还在顾客面前争吵
我之前在Suntec那边吃那边的服务真的很好，整体体验也可以，但我来jurong这里吃，真的太差，当下是很繁忙没错，当似乎一直想赶我们走，尤其是经理真的特别让人反感，这样的人也可以招聘的吗？不进行挑选员工的素质吗？

Second, I said there were two of us when I entered the store, and it was also written on the bill that there were two of us. I only ordered one bowl of rice when I ordered dishes and rice, and then a manager came to ask me if there were two of us. I kept repeating that there were two of us, but the manager in black didn’t believe that there were two of us, and said he would take away another set of tableware for me. I even ordered two glasses of water! One person needs to order two glasses of water? He didn’t believe that there were two of us! The attitude is very, very bad, no kidding
Third, when paying the bill, I waited for a very long time, and the bill was always wrong. It was handled wrong again and again, and I kept asking for help. Then it seemed that they were arguing and shirking the responsibility, which made me and my friend wait there. The experience was very bad and unprofessional. They also argued in front of customers
I ate at Suntec before and the service there was really good, and the overall experience was also OK, but I came to Jurong to eat here, it was really too bad.

The star of the show, of course, was the prata. It was hot, fresh, and incredibly fluffy. The outer layer was perfectly crispy, giving way to the most delicate and tender layers within. The choice of flavors and accompaniments was impressive, from classic plain prata to a variety of exciting options like cheese, egg, and even banana prata for those with a sweet tooth. The generous portion sizes ensured I left with a satisfied belly.

What truly stood out was the attention to detail in the preparation. The prata was made to order, ensuring it arrived at the table piping hot and bursting with flavor. The combination of the prata's softness and the well-balanced seasoning made each bite a delightful experience.

The stall's commitment to quality was evident not only in the prata but also in the side dishes and dipping sauces. The accompanying curry was rich and flavorful, and the various dips provided the perfect complement to the prata.

In summary, this prata stall offers a top-notch culinary experience with hot, fluffy prata that's a cut above the rest. The exceptional service and food quality make it a must-visit for anyone looking to indulge in this beloved Singaporean dish.",,Aaysha's Cuisine,4.3,

- Pimientos de Padron (a perennial favourite of ours. Was good but not something to  say much about as they’re just deep fried Padron peppers with flaky salt)
- Grilled Sucrine Lettuce with fine herbs yoghurt, macadamia nuts & cider vinegar (lovely zing to it, wonderfully crunchy, and the yoghurt sauce with what we think was mint was just fantastic)
- Smoked Burrata with pickled beetroot, Tom Kha Gai broth & fried peanuts (this was epic and the inventiveness of the dish is just testament of the innovation in Spanish dishes. Using burrata that is something typically western and marrying it with Southeast-Asian flavours in the Tom Kha Gai broth created a lovely and tasty offspring)
- Carabinero Prawn Fideua with crispy baby squid (Could have been better if the socarrat wasn’t that caramelised as that made it rather hard and challenging to chew. But despite that, the flavours were amazing - prawns and squids were super tasty)
- Spanish Suckling Pig with rhubarb and green apple, and red wine jus (superbly tender, skin was very crispy, and the undertones of red peppercorns gave it a deeper layer of flavour)

Only one small little complaint - music was a tad loud and choices didn’t quite match the vibe of the lovely setting.

Restaurant Fine dining restaurant,FALSE,TRUE,M Wong,69,346,3,"We came to this two Michelin-starred restaurant on a weekday evening. From the moment we entered, we received warm hospitality and were very much looking forward to dinner.

Before the meal began, the waiter brought out three bottles of wine and, without mentioning the price, asked if we’d like to start with sparkling wine or champagne. When we explained that we didn’t want to drink alcohol on a weekday, the waiter was very enthusiastic and immediately recommended some non-alcoholic drinks. At that moment, we felt very well taken care of, but also a little pressured to order some beverages—so we ended up ordering two non-alcoholic drinks.

As for the food, the meat dishes were generally more impressive. Both the pigeon and the beef were delicious, perfectly seasoned and cooked just right. In contrast, the appetizers and seafood dishes felt like they used expensive ingredients, but there was nothing particularly outstanding in terms of seasoning, accompaniments, or cooking techniques. There was a hint of Sri Lankan flavor in the seasoning, but it didn’t deliver the kind of surprise you’d expect from a two-star restaurant—whether in presentation, taste, or cooking.

For dessert, we were asked to move upstairs to another floor. Once we got there, we actually wished we could have stayed downstairs, as the décor and atmosphere upstairs didn’t match the style you’d expect from a two-star restaurant—it felt more like a café that hadn’t been renovated in a long time. The savory desserts were interesting and impressive, but the environment and music really affected the experience. We didn’t understand why guests were asked to go upstairs.

Overall, we left feeling a bit disappointed. The ingredients were high quality, and Laila’s (?) service was very attentive, but everything else didn’t meet our expectations for a two-star restaurant—whether it was the food presentation, the element of surprise, or the rest of the service.

Restaurant Fine dining restaurant,FALSE,TRUE,Stacey L,47,346,5,"In the ever-evolving landscape of culinary art, Chef Rishi stands as a beacon of innovation, exemplifying the essence of fusion cuisine. His Michelin accolades are not merely ornamental; they are a testament to a creativity that dares to transcend cultural boundaries.

My introduction to this culinary sanctuary was a delightful surprise orchestrated by my husband, who kept the details tantalizingly under wraps. As I savored the initial bites, a hushed revelation escaped my lips: “This must be at least a Michelin-starred establishment.” The truth, I learned, was even grander: a two-star Michelin rating, a distinction that, after the meal, felt entirely justified.

Each dish was a symphony of textures—the satisfying crunch, the delicate chew, the harmonious interplay of moist and drier elements—each flavor danced on the palate, engaging the senses without one overpowering the others. Familiar, yet profoundly innovative, the use of bold ingredients like laksa leaf and Vegemite was entirely reimagined, blurring the lines of any singular cuisine. It was as if a new culinary genre was being born before my very eyes.

What captivated me most was the element of surprise nestled within each presentation. I was taken aback by the sweetness that emerged from what I had always considered savory, particularly in a dish as unexpected as a cauliflower dessert. How could something so traditionally earthy project such an astonishingly sweet essence, yet taste nothing like a mundane salad?

Furthermore, the freshness of the core ingredients was striking. The oysters were a revelation—so pristine that they eschewed the typical briny tang, allowing me to experience them for the very first time with unadulterated pleasure.

It is an exceptional talent to harmonize such diverse flavors, and Chef Rishi’s accomplishment in doing so truly merits the Michelin stars awarded to this establishment. My only note of dissent centered on the A4 Wagyu; I had hoped for its melt-in-your-mouth allure, which sadly fell short.

Still, I find myself compelled to assign an unprecedented score of 13 out of 10. While I could continue to extol the virtues of each dish, I advise you to embark on your own tasting journey.

In most of the Michelin star restaurants I go to, I’d always see the chef. Not here though. And the only reason why this is so it’s that everyone here has an equal significance to the culinary contribution. The team is great, well trained and everyone who dons an apron is a chef themselves. In other words, the team is the chef.

There were 2 things that came to mind when eating at this place. One, every dish is paired with matching crockery and cutlery. The cutlery stand is themed to whatever dish you are having. Every dish has its own theme. Two, each dish keeps getting better. It’s as though the sequence was well plotted to escalate your satisfaction until you reach the sweets. And even that took the same concept, if it were intended.

The entire dining experience is defined accurately - it’s a tasting menu. You don’t get to be filled too much of an independent dish. You get a taste and then you end up craving for more, only to be surprised by another tricky the chefs have up their sleeves. It keeps people coming back for more and indeed a few other guests were there 2nd maybe 3rd time. It’s worth returning to see how creative they have improvised over time.

Be prepared to shell out $500 for yourself to just savor a little of everything. But be comfortable enough because one thing that was intended by the head chef himself is for you to feel at home. A very nicely decorated home.",,Cloudstreet,4.7,

It’s been over 40mins and the food has yet to be served at 7.04PM.

She then went on to complain about the matter to the male boss—all over a mere $0.20 takeaway box.

To be clear, I had no issue paying for the box and did not show any reluctance to pay. What truly left a bad taste was the way she treated the young staff member. He was hardworking and polite, constantly running around serving and clearing tables, with no sign of slacking.

Ordered yellow noodle medium size for $6 and the fried prawn roll $10 for 8 pieces.

It was an average bowl of fishball noodles for me. Personally I like their meatball over the fishball and prawn ball. There’s abit of fishy taste in their fishballs which I do not enjoy. The sauce for the noodles were average though there’s pieces of lard in it but there’s an absent of the pork lard aroma in the noodles. The prawn rolls are quite delightful but only good if you have people to share it with.

I much enjoyed dining there on a quiet weekday morning. It was around 9am and there wasn’t any queue. The Indian lady who speaks very good mandarin is very friendly too.

Restaurant ,FALSE,TRUE,SuperShades SG Sunglasses and Barbershop,94,341,1,"Hi all , after all the hype and “hidden jem” reported by the millennial food influencers, I decided to give this famous stall another try after almost 8 years.

I was greeted by many black birds hopping around the place and flies flying around the tables. Cleanliness is bad. Vegetables was placed right outside the toilet. Oh god. For the hype and  I paid higher price i expected food to be delivered by them since they have many helpers and place is small but they chose to use digital token system self serve. Bad.

For the long queue and you need to carrying bowls of hot soup, it is just accident waiting to happen. Do not recommend older people or kids to come. If you come during lunch prepare to sweat and wait and sweat. For your info medium is $6 and large is $8. Which is quite high for HDB kopitiam price with no aircon.

Food taste is normal only barely even passable. My friends said during lunch time quality drops maybe because they are rushing. In my humble opinion, Many other places are better and with bigger portions. I would say their fish ball is ok a bit soggy,  wonder if it is like that for hand made. There is no visible difference between medium and large so when I went to ask, the lady with a black face just threw me a tiny tiny abalone which does not taste like one. Then an Indian lady said the noodles portion is more also. Looked the same as the medium my partner got. So no mistake . I joked that the noodles would be hardly enough for a hungry primary school kid. Some other patrons beside me burst into laughter.

Overall this place is not worth the hype and time to travel. If you live nearby seems like no choice lor, nothing else similar within reasonable walking distance but I am pretty sure outside if u travel further there are better and cheaper choices. But like I said if u want me to pay premium for such small portions u got to work harder on the things like bigger fans, I not asking for air con, improve cleanliness, food safety and maybe a bit of service like bringing to the table.

Restaurant ,FALSE,FALSE,Lim Jun Sheng,5,567,2,"Arrived at 6 PM on a Sunday to find the restaurant about 70% full, but the lack of a proper queuing system was immediately apparent. Customers were left to fend for themselves, with some waiting extended periods without any acknowledgment or assistance from staff. This chaotic approach to seating was a poor first impression.

Despite a mandatory 10% service charge, the ordering process was entirely self-service via a QR code. Essentially, the 'service' amounted to food delivery to the table. Even basic condiments like vinegar and chili were not provided, requiring customers to retrieve them from a communal area. This disconnect between the service
service charge and the actual service rendered was frustrating.

The beef noodle soup itself was adequate in terms of portion size, with four generous chunks of beef. However, the noodles were disappointingly soggy, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the dish. While the taste was acceptable, it wasn't enough to compensate for the service and noodle texture issues.

While the generous beef portion was a plus, the disorganized service, self-service ordering despite a service charge, and subpar noodle texture leave much to be desired. I'm unlikely to return, and this restaurant won't be my priority in the future.",,Huang Tu Di Xi’An Delights,4.1,

The dishes all have a comforting, homecooked quality to them, though the prices are pretty high for the portion sizes, certainly when compared to other Peranakan places like it. Ultimately, decent for a first-timer's sampler of Peranakan fare, but I probably wouldn't recommend this restaurant over other, far more affordable places like it.

Liked:
- Nasi ulam. A touch too salty, but very fragrant with the usual notes of lemongrass and other characteristic spices.
- Bakwang Kepiting soup. For $15 a serving, it definitely doesn't feel at al worth the price, being a tiny single serving with two measly meatballs. But the soup is an explosion of thunderous flavor and the meatballs definitely have a touch of homemade love to them.
- Achar. A medley of the usual pineapple, cucumber and carrots, but fortified with shaved lemongrass to make for a piquant pickle to go with the carbs on the table.

Mid:
- Beef rendang. The beef is somewhat stringy and the rendang is somewhat too watery and lacking in depth. Very underwhelming.

Must order:
1. 口水鸡 - this is by far one of the best KSJ I’ve had. The cut of chicken is really thick and there isn’t skin. The sauce also matches really well with the peanut and cucumber!
2. tomato crispy pork beehoon - the soup is like a thick version of the tomato soup in HDL. The pork had more flour to it but matched so well with the soup. Noodle wise is thick beehoon but I would prefer the 拉面 they use for their other noodle dishes
3. Sour plum drink - funny story, the picture in the menu was a bowl of sourplum drink so we expected it to be served that way but was pleasantly surprised it came in a plastic cup 😂 nonetheless, a good drink
4. 炸酱面 - sauce was great and I LOVE THE NOODLES (amazing bite)

The alright:
1. Dou pi - pretty unique, I was expecting some Beancurd skin thing but it ended up being egg crepe with glutinous rice. Was a tad full by the time I had this dish so I couldn’t quite appreciate it.
2. Shrimp/ Beef & Tripe Hot Dry Noodle - the noodles are great but somehow these 2 dishes had a powdery soy kind of flavour which I wasn’t a fan of

Apparently originating from Malaysia, the ingredients are first stir fried in a wok under high heat before adding the porridge base. When done correctly, the wok hei aroma permeates throughout the porridge, adding an extra dimension to a dish that for many represents the epitome of comfort food.

My favorite example of this porridge however doesn't even make it to Google's list of fried porridge in Singapore (again, you get plenty of porridge that isn't actually fried). Add to that, WSL is located in an industrial area not easily accessible by public transport (the nearest MRT being Joo Koon which is a 15 min walk away).

You don't have to worry about eating cold porridge here. The thick flavorful porridge is served piping hot in a claypot that takes a long while to cool down. Even at $6 it still represents fair value given how generous they were with ingredients. They keystone of this dish however,  is the wok hei and it's front and centre in WSL's porridge.

Ibid餐厅，由《Master Chef Asia》第一届冠军Chef Wu创立，一直是我心中的美食宝藏。这次是我第五次来，虽然前几道菜表现平平，但主食开始就一路惊喜，让我再次被征服！
----
一、面包与前菜
•  酸面团面包：一如既往的稳定发挥，搭配混合香油黄油，香气扑鼻，每次吃都幸福感爆棚！
•  南洋风味小金杯：创意十足，但味道中规中矩，皮蛋酱汁有点特别，但整体感觉一般。
•  印度风味小脆球（旗鱼+莴笋）：旗鱼搭配莴笋，再加上酸酸的味道，清爽开胃，搭配巧妙，但记忆度不深刻
•  羊肉塔塔配紫苏叶：作为前菜，这道菜让我眼前一亮。羊肉非常嫩，没有任何腥味，搭配紫苏叶，清新又鲜美，印象深刻。
•  豆腐配小番茄：用日本米酒和糖腌制，除了酸没有其他想法。
二、主菜
•  日式茶碗蒸蛋：肉末和辣辣甜甜的调味，再加上一点日本蛤蜊和辣椒油，味道有点复杂，我个人不太喜欢，但朋友觉得还可以。
•  新西兰三文鱼：这道菜惊艳！三文鱼腌制后制成，外皮薄脆，鱼肉处理得非常特别，完全参不透处理方式，口感层次丰富。
•  牛肉：这道菜是我的最爱！用红酒酱汁调味，酸甜适中，牛肉口感极佳，嚼劲十足，非常满足。
三、甜品
•  酸味甜品：山楂味的雪冰冰淇淋搭配酸奶，撒上烤干的番茄皮，酸甜交织，清新解腻。
•  香蕉冰淇淋配焦糖核桃：香蕉冰淇淋浓郁香甜，焦糖核桃增加了口感的层次，顶上的薄脆饼片更是点睛之笔，太好吃了！
四、饮品
最后的冷萃奶香乌龙茶，搭配手工糯米粉玛德琳蛋糕，完美收尾。蛋糕脆脆的，热乎乎的，非常美味。
----
五、服务与环境
餐厅的环境一如既往的舒适，服务也很贴心。Chef Wu每次见到都感觉很喜庆，这次好像瘦了一点，但依然亲切。还有印度厨师Daniel和餐厅经理Alex，他们都非常专业。这次Alez还用中文介绍菜品很详细，体验感很好。
----
六、总结
Ibid餐厅的套餐价格重回188++（人均230新币），性价比超高！虽然前几道菜有点平淡，但后面的惊喜让我觉得值回票价。每一道菜都有独特的创意和味道，无论是创意菜还是经典菜，都能感受到厨师的用心。强烈推荐给大家，下次还会再来！","The fifth time I checked in at Ibid Restaurant, from ordinary to full of surprises! ✨
Ibid Restaurant, founded by Chef Wu, the first champion of ""Master Chef Asia"", has always been a food treasure in my heart. This is my fifth time here. Although the first few dishes were mediocre, the main course has been surprising all the way, which conquered me again!
----
1. Bread and appetizers
• Sour dough bread: As stable as always, paired with mixed sesame oil and butter, the aroma is fragrant, and every time I eat it, I feel happy!
• Nanyang-style small golden cup: full of creativity, but the taste is quite satisfactory. The preserved egg sauce is a bit special, but the overall feeling is average.
• Indian-style small crispy balls (swordfish + lettuce): swordfish is paired with lettuce, plus the sour taste, refreshing and appetizing, the combination is clever, but the memory is not deep
• Lamb tartare with perilla leaves: As an appetizer, this dish made me shine. The lamb is very tender, without any fishy smell, paired with perilla leaves, fresh and delicious, impressive.
• Tofu with cherry tomatoes: marinated with Japanese rice wine and sugar, there is no other idea except sour.
2. Main course
• Japanese chawan mushi: minced meat and spicy and sweet seasoning, plus a little Japanese clams and chili oil, the taste is a bit complicated. I personally don’t like it, but my friends think it’s okay.
• New Zealand salmon: This dish is amazing! The salmon is marinated and made with a thin and crispy skin. The fish meat is handled very specially. The processing method is completely incomprehensible, and the taste is rich.
• Beef: This dish is my favorite! Seasoned with red wine sauce, the sweet and sour taste is moderate, the beef tastes excellent, and it is chewy and very satisfying.
3. Dessert
• Sour dessert: Hawthorn-flavored snow ice cream is paired with yogurt, sprinkled with roasted tomato skin, sour and sweet interweaving, refreshing and greasy.
• Banana ice cream with caramel walnuts: The banana ice cream is rich and sweet, the caramel walnuts increase the taste, and the thin cracker slices on the top are the finishing touch, so delicious!
4. Drinks
The last cold brew milky oolong tea, paired with handmade glutinous rice flour Madeleine cake, was the perfect ending. The cake was crispy, warm and delicious.
----
5. Service and environment
The environment of the restaurant is as comfortable as ever, and the service is very considerate. Chef Wu always feels very festive when I see him. This time he seems to be a little thinner, but still friendly. There are also Indian chef Daniel and restaurant manager Alex, who are both very professional. This time Alez also introduced the dishes in Chinese in detail, and the experience was very good.

6. Summary
The set meal price of Ibid restaurant has returned to 188++ (230 SGD per person), which is very cost-effective! Although the first few dishes were a bit bland, the surprise at the end made me feel that it was worth the price. Each dish has unique creativity and taste.

Asian fusion restaurant Restaurant,FALSE,TRUE,Madison Hurr,129,870,5,"From the moment I stepped into Ibid, the experience felt personal and deeply considered. The staff greeted me by name—an elegant touch that set the tone for the evening, and at my seat was a bottle of Aesop hand sanitizer, a thoughtful gesture.

What stood out immediately was the team’s attentiveness to my time constraints and dietary preferences. The kitchen was not only well-briefed but executed with seamless precision, delivering a menu that was as accommodating as it was inventive.

Notable entrees were the New Zealand farmed salmon, salt-cured and aged for four days. It arrived delicately seasoned atop a bed of spinach and edamame, complemented by a Chinese seaweed soy milk sauce infused with sake and rice vinegar. The flavors were subtle, fresh, and remarkably balanced…East meeting West in harmony.

Next the maitake mushrooms, expertly seared on high heat with brown butter. They were paired with a cacio e pepe-style risotto made from blended tofu, soy milk, and pecorino cheese. Pickled local fruit cut through the richness beautifully, adding texture and a bright, acidic contrast.

Lastly, a hybrid Wagyu-Angus beef from New South Wales, a standout both in flavor and sourcing. The chef, who clearly takes pride in ethical sourcing, explained the nuances of muscle and fat distribution in the cut. The beef was accompanied by daikon, a red wine curry jus, and a house-made BBQ paste.

Throughout, Ibid impressed with its creativity and its seamless fusion of Eastern and Western flavors.

The Bahn Mih was a big disappointment, the bread was not at all crisp, nor were there sufficient pickled vegetables nor did they give a fresh crunch. The experience as that of biting into a soft bun not a crisp baugette. The Pho looked decent and was a acceptable serving size but completely lacked any depth of flavour. The only passing dishes were the spring rolls both fried and fresh. Even then they deserved just a passing grade.

I expected normal stale lemon barley but what came was sparkly, refreshing and addictive. Something so much different than what i had thought initially. My buddy had the thai ice tea and needless to say it was smooth, sweet and delicious!

Ordered Nasi Lemak with Beef Salted Egg (you can pick your protein) and the Indo Maggi with Ayam Kunyit (you can pick your protein) to dine in. Added the Vietnamese egg fried rice for takeaway.
I guess it was lunch time hence my nasi lemak came a bit later but it was okay cause when it came the smell was so fragrant.

Nasi Lemak:
Rice was coconutty (delicious!) used basmati rice i assume
Ikan Bilis - Fried and crispy
Beef salted egg - Gonna be honest i love beef and it was my first time eating it with salted egg. However, i got to say they made it worked. It was delicious, addictive, and tender.
Sambal - For me personally it was not on the spicy side, but it had the sweet and salty taste that was needed. Dont really eat sambal so honestly i cant say much 🥲🥲

Sorry i cant say much about the Indo Maggi cause my buddy devoured it! All he said was, “Bro, just let me eat, its delicious.”

The dishes each were anchored on a familiar local flavour - such as their take on kueh pie tee, or congee with lap cheong, but were also incredibly inventive and complex. We felt this helped to elevate them above the often routine “tartlets” and “foams” we’ve had at other restaurants which often seem to fade from memory.

The restaurant is mostly counter seating and this brought both staff and kitchen front and centre in the entire experience. Chef Wai Leong and his team gave the best service we could ever ask for, and we were entertained by Chef’s personal and amusing anecdotes throughout the evening.

You have to come out first. I'm a person who doesn't like to eat food that has a strong smell. But I'm not a difficult person to eat, as long as it's delicious, I can eat it all ><

But, for this place, would it be too harsh to say that not one dish will wow me? The taste of food is difficult to understand. Or we can't reach it, I don't know. Some dishes have a good combination of ingredients but the texture doesn't. Some dishes have a good smell and good texture, but the taste is too sweet, too salty, and that's it.

Overall, it's just one round. 😅

而且这已经不是第一次出现问题了。上次在你们家的星洲炒粉里吃出了塑料片，当时就应该直接举报到食品管理局去。除此之外，店内环境也堪忧，每次吃完回家衣服上都会带蚂蚁。

说实话，这样的安全隐患、服务态度和卫生状况，实在无法接受。以后肯定不会再来了。","I have long heard that the service attitude of some restaurants in Singapore is not satisfactory. Today's experience in this restaurant has set a new limit for me.

We smelled a pungent smell of gas as soon as we entered the door. Out of concern for the safety of our meal, we politely asked the waiter to go to the kitchen to check. But the other party said coldly, ""You can eat as you like"" and took our menu away. This attitude makes me couldn't help but want to ask: Does the ""safe entry and exit"" written on your door look good?

And this isn't the first time something has gone wrong. Last time I ate plastic pieces in your Sin Chew Fried Rice Noodles, I should have reported it directly to the Food Administration.

Bar & grill Beer store,FALSE,TRUE,C L,50,588,1,"Very disappointing experience. Went there on father's day and also to celebrate my sister's birthday.
Wasnt given a fair treatment. Initially when we went, they mentioned the seats inside were reserved. After that, we saw a table that was being cleared up. Asked the staff if we could change and they told us we will be notified once available. Then came a couple after we asked to change seats and they also asked to change seats to the ones inside. They sat outside for awhile and in the end the cleared table was given to them without even notifying us.
The weather was hot and humid and there wasn't even a fan at our table. Halfway through our meal, the rain suddenly came and contaminated everything on our table including the food but was only brushed off with a “不好意思”.
My family also commented that the food was not fresh, which I also felt that way as I previously ordered delivery from them and I know that their normal standards weren't like this. The 酸梅汤 was also accompanied with a strong hint of bitterness which just added to our displeasure.
Also, the fire for the heating pad which is supposed to keep our food warm wasn't even lighted up properly. We only found out after finishing our first round of skewers.
Overall, the experience in store was terrible and when settling the bill, the staff kept pushing us to sign up for member and load a minimum of $300 to get the free credits even after we declined. Even though we spent $240, we felt that we definitely wouldn't visit again.",,BBQ Box 串烧工坊,4.9,

Queen of steak (10/10) was grilled to the perfect doneness so it did not have any blood taste. We chose Sze chuan sauce (but it’s not spicy) and it goes well with the beef. Salt is already sprinkled beforehand so it brings out the taste of the beef, but it is only recommended for people who like the fatter cuts. The dessert Classic Crepe (10/10!!!!!!) is very good.

I had informed your staff that I might be late, providing an estimated arrival time of 7:30 PM. However, I received a call stating they could not hold the table for that long because they needed it back by 8:30 PM.

I am quite frustrated with this situation. I was asked to pay a deposit of $200 for my reservation of 13 people. I was initially hesitant because I knew there would be separate billing among the group, but I went ahead and paid the deposit. Given this, I expected your staff to be more accommodating regarding the timing. You request payment upfront, yet it seems your staff was unable to reciprocate.

Upon my arrival, one of your staff members made an inappropriate remark: ""Ni eh, dorang yang lambat?"" This comment was not acceptable.

I had to rush through my meal, turning the birthday dinner into a hurried experience. When it was time to pay, the bill was presented as a single receipt. I had already informed your staff that the $200 deposit should only offset my portion of the bill. Splitting the payment was inconvenient, especially since the meals did not include tax and GST, which I had to calculate separately.

Your staff could have found a solution at that moment. I believe I am not the only patron making reservations from 7 PM to 8:30 PM.

Hot pot restaurant ,FALSE,FALSE,tan gladdys,11,1128,2,"一直是海底捞的老顾客，以前在新加坡多家分店用餐都很愉快。但 2025 年 8 月 在该分店的免费美甲服务，却是我最失望的一次体验。

📌 等待时间过长
周末明确写明不提供卸甲服务、平均每人 35 分钟，但我等了近 3 小时，其中一个号码卡了 2 小时，最后才被告知前面有人在卸甲。规则与执行明显不一致。

📌 手法粗鲁+态度欠佳
轮到我时，先是被电话催促，结果到场后美甲师本人不在位，还等了十多分钟。期间不耐烦地拒绝我参考墙上的款式，明明说不用剪短指甲，仍被剪到拇指完全没有游离白边，影响日常。上色过程催促频繁、照灯时间不足，涂到皮肤上也不处理。

📌 公共区域体验不佳
用餐时查看 iPad，黑制服员工直接从我手中拿走并操作，没有任何说明或征询。

✅ 唯一亮点
内场粉色制服小姐姐非常贴心，服务细致，交接清楚。

我已将完整情况电邮至海底捞客服并提供所需信息，希望品牌能以专业与负责的态度认真处理 但至今仍未收到任何回复。

真是对品牌方的处理深感失望。

-当天的美甲师叫candy
-粉色衣服的内场人员是 娜娜跟sin wei","I've been a regular Haidilao customer and have enjoyed dining at several branches in Singapore. However, the free manicure at this branch in August 2025 was my most disappointing experience.

📌 Excessive Waiting Time
It's clearly stated on weekends that nail polish removal is not available and the average waiting time is 35 minutes per person, but I waited for nearly three hours. One number was stuck for two hours before I was finally informed that someone else was removing their nails. There's a clear inconsistency between the rules and enforcement.

📌 Rude Techniques + Poor Attitude
When it was my turn, I was first rushed by phone. The manicurist wasn't there when I arrived, so I waited for over ten minutes. During this time, they impatiently refused to let me refer to the designs on the wall. They clearly told me not to cut my nails short, but they still cut my thumb to the point where there was no free white edge, which disrupted my daily routine. The coloring process was frequently rushed, the lighting was insufficient, and the paint didn't get cleaned up after it was applied to my skin.

📌 Poor experience in the public areas

While checking my iPad during a meal, a black-uniformed employee took it from me and began using it without any explanation or consultation.

✅ The only positive point

The pink-uniformed women in the backroom were very attentive, providing meticulous service and a clear handover.

I have emailed Haidilao customer service with the full details and provided the requested information, hoping the brand will handle this professionally and responsibly. However, I have yet to receive a response.

I am deeply disappointed with the brand's handling of this situation.

She also claimed she lost my order sheet. I was shocked by her reply and told her that I was not informed on this. She ended up refunding me the additional $5 without an apology.

In summary, I was charged extra $5 because an additional item was added to my order without my knowledge and the cashier tried to justify the additional charge, which was only refunded after I called out on it.

At 11:30am, the stall restaurant was empty except for a group of middle-aged women eating, animatedly in conversation, at the corner. What first caught my attention was how sparse the tables were inside, and how crammed they were outside. Inside the restaurant, there was one table of four, and three tables of two. Outside, the tables were crammed back-to-back, so that the seats were touching each other even when nobody was seated there yet. Being quite crowd-phobic, I decided against sitting outside, and took a two-seater inside while waiting for a friend. I ordered the chicken dum biryani. Perhaps because of the hype that I had heard about this restaurant, the biryani fell slightly short of expectations, but it was nonetheless very delicious still. Call me a frog-in-the-well, but I was looking forward to curry-soaked rice, just like how I like my biryani at Springleaf Prata. I was quite surprised when there was no curry served with the rice. But the fact that it continued to appeal to my taste buds, in spite of that, is testament to its taste. Now, I must confess, that writing here did earn my a small stick of ice-cream, so whatever I write here, as honest as I try to be, I will understand if you read with suspicion or doubt. So, to that, I will just say, ""You have to try it for yourself (and get your free ice-cream while at that)!""",,Bismillah Biryani,4.6,

Honestly, this is one of the best herbal-style Bak Kut Teh I’ve had in Singapore, probably the closest you’ll get to the rich, robust flavours of Klang-style BKT. The soup was deeply herbal, layered with a complex blend of ingredients that gave it a warm, comforting depth. Plus, free soup refills are always a win.

The dry version was equally impressive, flavourful, with that signature salted fish aroma that adds an addictive umami kick. The sauce was thick and nicely caramelised, coating the meat beautifully.

The food was fantastic! Tentalizing with bomb of favours. I couldn't resist the various flavor exchanging and transiting from the Queen of steak with their own special chimichuri sauce, to the side of Brussel sprouts and complimentary cocktail, born from the barista creation.

Steak was rich in favour, sufficient seasoning allowing one to indulge the flavor of the steak cut even without the sauce. However I'd highly recommend the sauces which elevate the flavour profile allowing one to enjoy while providing different pleasant experience.

Above all else, as if the food alone isn't enough to give it a 5 star rating, the service and the crew are the main highlight of this oasis.

Every time we find ourselves in Jurong Point, there's only one place on our minds — Brio. This isn't just a restaurant; it's our go-to comfort spot, our ""must-stop"" destination. With every visit, Brio reminds us why it's always worth coming back — and we do, wholeheartedly.

The food? Always satisfying. The flavours are bold yet balanced, and the presentation is just the cherry on top. Whether it's a quick bite or a full-on feast, Brio delivers every single time. Their menu strikes the perfect chord between variety and quality — a rare combination that makes each meal memorable.

But what truly sets Brio apart is the consistent warmth — both in the service and the atmosphere. It's the kind of place that feels like home, but better. You walk in and you're greeted not just with a smile, but with a sense of familiarity and care that’s hard to find.

Brio is always a gem — shining brightly in the heart of Jurong Point. If you're ever in the area, do yourself a favour: go to Brio. And if you're like us, you'll find yourself always coming back.",,Brio,4,

Had the Cream pasta and their signature prawn tomato pasta. Cream pasta was bland.   Prawn tomato was alright. Their local fried rice was average.

Was surprised the shop has not taken steps to be more transparent with the customers about the pricing of their special pork chop even after a couple of reviews left here about it.

Server was still introducing the item to customers and there was no mention of price nor is it on the menu.

I was one of those who had ordered and not known about the price back then. I had told the server to be inform customer about the price. It should be updated on their specials menu at the main door which they had back then. Yes, customer should have asked but for a shop at the heartlands, 36 bucks would not be a figure you are expecting.

If you are interested to order, my first impression of it was it tasted more like crispy pata than pork chop.

What we tried;

💙 Fresh Salmon Trout Fillet

Definitely my favourite as I am a salmon & Omega3 fan! This dish is so fresh and well cooked that I am addicted and cleaned the plate ! The skin is so crispy until I can feel the ASMR crunch!

Served with smooth and easy-to-eat potato mash and vegetable medley.

💙 Signature BBQ Pork Ribs

Rarely do I find such tender pork ribs which falls off the bones easily. Fresh and great texture without being overwhelming we love!

💙 Signature Spaghetti Prawns

Now I know why this is the most popular dish! Exquisite pasta with fresh prawns in the yummy, tangy sauce!

💙 Wild Mushroom Soup & Garlic Bread

Really homely taste just like the perform comfort companion!

💙 Grilled chicken Chop & Sausage

老Boy said he will come back for this! He really enjoy the crispy and delicious textures and taste!

💙 BBQ Sambal Stingray

He likes the fresh stingray and finished everything!

💙 Sliced Batang Fish Soup

Served with Sambal Balacan, this is the ultimate comfort soup with thick fresh slices of Batang. Suits us who prefer lighter soups.

Water - The water cup I was served was not properly cleaned, and I found bits of lime pulp and residue inside the water cup.
Aglio olio - this is pretty inconsistant. Sometimes it's nice, sometimes it's too spicy, and other times is has a strange smell and taste to it, similar to a sweet chemical-like taste.

Today I tried their Argentinian Angus Ribeye & Garlic Shrimps Tapas.  Beef is grilled just right (medium well), though i would feel that a smaller piece of truffle butter should be enough. It was slightly too oily for me.  Salad is refreshing and garlic shrimps tapas is ok. Tomato soup is good as usual. Staff are attentive and I enjoyed my lunch here!

Feb 2025 update
This time their fish and chips improved.  Attentive waiter has been around for the 2 occasions I visited recently.  He will always gave my daughter the cheese flakes for her pasta!!  Good job.

Dec 2024 update
Hot tomato has changed their menu.  The mushroom soup and tomatoes soup are still delicious as ever.  The fish and chips is a little bland, can be a little saltier. Otherwise takes with tartar sauce is just right.

The location is also very strategic, close to many key places, so it's convenient for getting around.

That said, the room layout could be improved. The corridor inside the room is extremely narrow — only one person can walk through at a time, which makes moving around a bit tricky. Also, the main door opens inward, and if someone is climbing up to their bed, the door can swing and hit them if another guest enters at the same time.

Storage space is limited. Only two of the four guests can store their luggage under the beds inside the room. The other two have to use lockers located outside the room, which is less convenient. Even for those who can store luggage inside, the space is tight and you often have to bring your suitcase outside the room to open it.

We did use our corridor chairs a lot so it was great to have this view. |Check in was such an ordinary experience. The Iconic doorman wasn’t there, we did have many photos and see him a lot on other days. We were not offered, freshly scented hand towels, we were not offered a chilled water with cucumber or Lemon, just a warm tetra bottle after we asked. We got the virtuoso upgrade, which was good. We had our Singapore Sling a few hours later , it was delicious and came with raw peanuts and the room butler offered us 5 or 6 chocolates. We had a baby with us and were very shocked to see the totally inappropriate welcome gift for him, a large cellophane blow up balloon . Totally inappropriate and unsafe, as it could scare him when it popped and small particles could be a choking hazard. The cot provided was very old and even though the hotel is historical, the items they provide for a a baby should be updated. To their credit they did go and source the same a day a fabric padded bumper, so he would not wake every hour and get his arms stuck. |This hotel only has about 115 rooms, so the maximum amount of guests couldn’t exceed 300. I would have expected the breakfast staff to address me by name for a 3 day stay. They never did. I would have expected the way I liked my coffee to be remembered on day 2 and 3.  |But mostly as in other historical hotels and. Five or 6 star ones many generous aspects were lacking. Such as no free champagne or Prosecco at breakfast, I don’t even drink alcohol before 5 p.m but a hotel of this calibre ALWAYS has it available for guests NO CHARGE, in a big bucket and self serve. Guests love it, I have seen large groups or couples enjoying a champagne breakfast, frankly I was shocked it was unavailable. |I was actually embarrassed for the Hotel that nothing but a small plate of macaroons in the room and some cheap plastic flags on the pool deck was all they did for hotel guests on Singapore’s National 60th birthday celebrations. Gee it’s not like they have to do it yearly. Shame on management for such a poor show in national pride of one of the oldest and iconic hotels in South East Asia. Guests were told we could see some fireworks from the 3 rd story pool deck. It had zero atmosphere and nothing was provided. |This hotel could have repeat guests if they added more 5 star and less corporate feel to the stay. Our butler didn’t ever tell us what he could do for us. Such as free pressing and steaming of our clothes or the running of a bath, we were not informed about when the Raffles tours were and if we’d like to join . In Europe we stay at old iconic hotels and they offer so much more. Including the hotel car alway runs guests around short distances. We asked to go 1 klm with the baby to the Arab quarter and were told they charge us 26 SD. This doesn’t happen in Europe. Asia will never be at the service level of Europe but it’s such a shame to see a property like this which is so beautiful not measure up in services and management to its former glory and potential.

During our recent trip to Singapore, my partner and I had the absolute pleasure of dining at the Tiffin Room at Raffles Hotel — and it was, without question, the best Indian food I have ever tasted. Every dish was bursting with flavour, beautifully presented, and cooked to perfection.

What truly elevated the evening, however, was the impeccable hospitality. Roshan and his team were incredibly warm and attentive, going above and beyond to make our anniversary dinner truly special. From the moment we arrived, we felt welcomed, celebrated, and cared for.

After our meal, Roshan personally escorted us to the Long Bar, where he introduced us to KC, who, along with his wonderful team, ensured the celebration continued in style. We were treated to an array of expertly crafted cocktails, including several delicious interpretations of the world-famous Singapore Sling — each one a delightful twist on the classic.

From start to finish, the evening was flawless. Both the Tiffin Room and the Long Bar created memories we will cherish forever. Out of our five nights in Singapore, this was, without a doubt, the highlight of our holiday.

•	Check-in and room allocation: The room layout was unsafe for families. The TV was positioned in a way that required pulling it towards the bed, creating a risk for a small child. I raised this with reception within 5 minutes of checking in, but the staff said, “we can’t do anything.” They even blamed me for booking that room, even though no layout was provided during booking. Their only solution was to pay more to change rooms.
•	Breakfast issue: Our booking clearly included breakfast for 2 adults and 1 child. On the first morning, the restaurant staff rudely insisted only 1 person was included. I showed the booking confirmation on the hotel’s own app, but reception still refused to honor it. I ended up paying almost $200 extra for breakfasts. What made this worse is that even after paying, their system was never updated. Every single morning, we had to explain the same issue at the restaurant, then go back to reception to bring someone to confirm we had already paid. This was embarrassing, frustrating, and showed how poorly the hotel managed guest services.
•	Room electrical problems: On 3 different days, the room lights kept switching off while the aircon stayed on. Reception dismissed this, saying it was “sensor activity.” Only after I pressed firmly on the third day did they send an electrician, who found a faulty sensor. No apology was offered.
•	Housekeeping: Housekeeping service was inconsistent. On some days, the room was left uncleaned despite requests. The staff themselves were polite and hardworking, but it seemed like poor management was the issue.

This was my third stay at this property (previously Parkroyal), but the change to Novotel has been a huge step backwards. Staff at reception were unprofessional and showed no willingness to solve problems.

We liked this hotel in the past, but after this experience, it will be our last stay here. I would strongly recommend avoiding this property, especially for families.",,Novotel Singapore on Kitchener,4.2,

Got plain water on the house for their service recovery, which is about $21 as it was $3 per head. Meanwhile, the 2 mains I ordered came at 7:43pm, which was roughly around 1 hour and 20minutes after I ordered the food. Ridiculous.

To make matters worse, the host (the guy in glasses) offered a ridiculous excuse, saying they were 'supposed to order them just now, but it was too late.'

I would be fine if the staff informed us that the dining time limit was a hard rule, and if they informed us that there is 10 minutes left and if we would like to settle the bill, but to try and subtly hint and pressure us is unprofessional.

The hotel offers spacious, clean, and exceptionally comfortable rooms, providing a relaxing environment for guests. The quality of the bathroom was particularly impressive, as it was spotlessly clean and well-maintained, contributing to a high level of comfort.

The hotel’s facilities were comprehensive, catering to all the essential needs of guests. Everything from amenities to the overall infrastructure was thoughtfully provided, ensuring a convenient stay.

What stood out most during my stay, however, was the exemplary service provided by the staff. Every member of the team was exceptionally friendly and helpful, creating a welcoming atmosphere throughout the hotel. A special mention goes to Glenda, a staff member who was particularly remarkable. She went above and beyond in assisting me with resolving an issue, offering practical and timely solutions that made my stay even more enjoyable.

He also came by to replenish our drinks without being asked — a small gesture that showed his attentiveness and commitment to customer comfort.

We observed that all staff members were working diligently, regularly checking on diners, offering grill changes, and replenishing drinks. It’s rare to see such a consistently high level of service across the board.

The hotel was a huge disappointment. The hotel design & room decor are poor:
(1) the reception area is cramped & during check in/out, people & bags impede access to the restaurant
(2) the restaurant is so small (& cramped) that it's necessary to wait in a queue for a table at breakfast
(3) combined, the reception/restaurant area is noisy & difficult to navigate.
(4) my room, a ""Superior Queen"" was so small that l had to step sideways between my suitcase & the bed - a gap of max 30cm
(5) the bathroom was so small that, when sitting on the lavatory, l could touch the facing wall of the room & shower door/wall, while the toilet paper holder was high on the wall BEHIND & above the lavatory. I estimate the size of the bathroom (ie shower stall + lavatory) at ~ 1.5m in each direction. I felt claustrophobic in the bathroom
(6) the room had a large round mirror with a switch on its surface which, when touched, lit up the outer ring of the mirror. When this ring light was switched off, the switch itself emited a bright blue light that could not be turned off or disabled. The room glowed bright blue all night & disturbed my sleep for the duration of my stay
(7) the bed was rock hard, like a solid surface without a mattress. My home mattress is extra firm & feels like a marshmallow by comparison.

This meant I repeatedly had to request Reception to increase the temperature in my room, so that it was any where near comfortable. However, whilst they would perhaps put the temperature up to 20degrees celsius for a few hours, it would then drop down again to freezing cold. I had 2 terribly uncomfortable, sleepless nights due to this problem! The service staff semmingky just did not understand the problem -- nor did they bpother to check by personally visiting the room to ascertain what the actual temperature was and why this might cause an issue for guests. On the second night, I ended up having to request blankets to be able to sleep -- which is utterly ridiculous considering the outside temperature overnight was about 32 degrees C. The rooms are also incredibly noisy, with people coming and going down the hall, throughout the night, with loud banging doors that are impossible to close quietly (even though they have a sign saying: ""Quiet Hours: 10pm - 6am"", it seems nobody adheres to this).

Restaurant ,FALSE,FALSE,edwin&colleen tan,5,557,5,"Looking at the menu and reviews, I was unsure of how the food at Lolla would turn out.
But after dinner here, I have to give my experience the best possible rating.
We picked 3 items of the menu, then asked for a recommendation for the 4th and later a 5th.
Master of the house & the other servers were prompt and attentive. Each went through promptly what they felt would suit us; not pushy, they didn't need to be, the dishes spoke for themselves.

Uni Spaghetti: fresh, distinct uni flavour complemented by the cauliflower puree, resulting in a smooth sauce with uni notes in every bite of the spaghetti.

Grilled Octopus: the octopus limb was well done, my first time savouring an octo tentacle that was tender at the joint, gradually more chewy in the middle, and an enjoyable bite at the end. Served on velvety mashed potatoes and garnished with 'salty fingers' (micro green), the earthy, leafy & bitter flavours paired well with the octopus.

Iberico secreto & duck fat potatoes:
Served together, the potato's were a delight. Work has been put in to ensure that each nib had a crisp exterior, gently salted, and a soft warm body. Potato perfection.
Pork was a good cut, with what looked like marbling in beef (I may be wrong). The surface was browned and savoury, the flesh well done and succulent. Served with a sauce (tasted of red) and a garnish of pickled veg which acted as a palate pause or rest before I took my next bite.
Since the 4 were so good, I wanted a 5th.

Hand torn pasta with Brown Crab: often I hear al-dente used (in SG) and I either get undercooked or well cooked pasta. These hand torn pasta strips, cooked through, have a good bite and chew to each. We rolled/folded the servings of shredded crab held together in a light buttery sauce. Very enjoyable.
Complements again to Chef and his team. Haven't had such a good dinner in SG for awhile now.",,Lolla,4.5,

螃蟹：冬阴功蟹肉汤，平平无奇。

3. 卫生间布局不合理，两个独立马桶间不分男女，男女共用洗手池。从马桶间出来以后和一位男顾客面面相觑，发现没有擦手纸…… 体验非常糟糕。

Cabbage: A super sweet version of hand-shredded cabbage, with butter, cheese, black vinegar and sugar. It is very, very, very sweet.
Pork: Super salty version of barbecued pork. I like salty food, but this pork dish was too salty. My tongue blistered after eating it, and it didn’t go away for a day.
Crab: Tom Yum Crab Meat Soup, mediocre.

2. Unsatisfactory hygiene. The toilet was not even cleaned, which greatly reduced one’s appetite! For a restaurant in this price range, this is unacceptable!

3. The layout of the bathroom is unreasonable. There are two separate toilets for men and women, and men and women share the sink. After coming out of the toilet room, I looked at each other with a male customer and found that there was no toilet paper... It was a very bad experience.

The room is a decent size — not too small — and the price is quite reasonable by Singapore standards (around 3,500 THB per night). Overall, it’s a good value option for this area. However, there are a few downsides: although I booked a single large bed, it turned out to be two smaller beds pushed together with a topper on top, leaving a noticeable gap in the middle, which made sleeping a bit uncomfortable.

🛁 In the bathroom, the sink was cracked, and the chair in the room was unstable — it kept falling apart and needed to be reassembled repeatedly. Due to these maintenance issues, I would deduct one star from my overall rating.

🚉 Location & Accessibility
The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location. It is the closest hotel to Paya Lebar MRT station, compared to others in the area. It’s also just a short walk to PLQ Mall, Paya Lebar Square, and SingPost Centre.

✨ I used to live and work in this neighborhood, so I chose this hotel specifically to revisit some of my favorite local food spots. For that purpose, the location was perfect.

Unfortunately we had some hurdles during the stay where housekeeping hadn't cleaned the room - this was after leaving the card on the door for the day and asking housekeeping to clean (they were cleaning the opposite room), dialling 0 several hours later and requesting housekeeping twice, and even approaching the housekeeping staff directly after another hour had passed (they then told us that they didn't want to clean the room today and would instead clean it tomorrow?).

The staff mentioned “this had happened to other guests before” and advised me to withdraw cash from an ATM. I contacted my all of my bank in my origin country, who confirmed that no transactions were attempted or declined — my cards were functioning fine. After returning about 30 minutes later, I was informed that the hotel’s system was actually down and that they would collect payment in the morning.

The entire concept is beautifully executed—it's not just a zoo or a park, but a space that invites you to slow down, observe, and appreciate the diversity of birdlife in a meaningful way.

The two bird presentations were definite highlights. They weren’t just flashy performances; they were well-paced, informative, and surprisingly funny at times. The trainers clearly know their birds well, and the way they wove in conservation messages without being preachy was impressive. I learned things I didn’t expect to, and the kids around me were fully engaged too—which says a lot.

The layout of the park is intuitive and immersive. Each aviary feels like a different world, and the transitions between zones are smooth and natural. I especially appreciated the attention to detail in the signage—clear, concise, and multilingual. It’s obvious that a lot of thought went into making this accessible to a wide range of visitors.

What stood out most was the atmosphere. It’s peaceful, clean, and well-maintained, with plenty of shaded areas and resting spots. You don’t feel rushed or overwhelmed. It’s the kind of place where you can take your time, reflect, and just enjoy being surrounded by nature.

Overall, Bird Paradise exceeded my expectations. It’s a place I’d recommend to anyone—families, educators, tourists, or just someone looking for a quiet, enriching day out.

 สิ่งที่ทำให้ผิดหวัง: รายละเอียดที่ควรใส่ใจ อย่างไรก็ตาม ความประทับใจเริ่มลดลงเมื่อเจอเข้ากับรายละเอียดที่ดูเหมือนจะถูกมองข้ามไป อย่างแรกคือ ขนาดห้องพักที่ค่อนข้างแคบ เมื่อเทียบกับราคาต่อคืน สำหรับนักเดินทางที่ต้องการพื้นที่ใช้สอยสบายๆ อาจรู้สึกอึดอัดเล็กน้อย เรื่องของ น้ำดื่ม ก็เป็นอีกจุดที่ต้องปรับตัว เพราะต้องไปเติมเองที่ชั้น 4 และหลังจาก 4 ทุ่มก็ต้องลงมาเติมที่ชั้นล่างแทน แม้จะไม่ใช่เรื่องใหญ่โต แต่ก็สร้างความไม่สะดวกสบายอยู่ไม่น้อย แต่ที่น่าผิดหวังที่สุดคงหนีไม่พ้น นโยบายการทำความสะอาดห้องพัก ทางโรงแรมระบุชัดเจนว่าจะทำความสะอาดห้องให้สำหรับผู้เข้าพักตั้งแต่คืนที่ 3 เป็นต้นไป 
นั่นหมายความว่าหากคุณพักเพียง 2 คืนอย่างฉัน จะไม่มีการทำความสะอาดห้องพักเลย ตลอดระยะเวลาที่อยู่ แม้จะไม่มีการทำความสะอาดห้องพักระหว่างการเข้าพัก 2 คืนแรก แต่ทางโรงแรมก็ มีการเปลี่ยนผ้าเช็ดตัวให้ ซึ่งเป็นเรื่องสำคัญที่ช่วยให้รู้สึกสะอาดและสบายตัวได้ในระดับหนึ่ง 
และจุดที่ทำให้รู้สึกแย่จนถึงขั้น ""ขยะแขยง"" คือสภาพของ กาต้มน้ำในห้องพัก ที่มี คราบสีเหลืองติดอยู่ ฉันพยายามเช็ดดูแล้วแต่ก็เหมือนคราบที่ฝังแน่น คล้ายกับ คราบขี้ฟันที่น่าขยะแขยง ซึ่งทำให้เกิดคำถามในใจว่า เหตุใดการทำความสะอาดห้องพักจึงไม่ได้ใช้น้ำยาทำความสะอาดและขัดถูให้สะอาดหมดจดในอุปกรณ์ที่แขกใช้ประจำ. 

บทสรุป: คุ้มค่าหรือไม่? (สำหรับผู้ที่อาจจะกลับมา) โดยสรุปแล้ว แม้โรงแรมจะมีข้อดีในเรื่องของสิ่งอำนวยความสะดวกบางอย่าง การเดินทางที่พอใช้ได้ และถึงแม้ว่ามีการเปลี่ยนผ้าเช็ดตัวให้จากการบริการของพนักงานโรงแรมเป็นอย่างดี แต่ประสบการณ์โดยรวมกลับถูกบั่นทอนลงด้วย มาตรฐานความสะอาดที่น่าผิดหวัง และ นโยบายการทำความสะอาดห้องที่ไม่ยืดหยุ่น โดยเฉพาะอย่างยิ่งปัญหาเรื่องคราบสกปรกในกาต้มน้ำที่แสดงให้เห็นถึงการขาดความใส่ใจในรายละเอียดเล็กๆ น้อยๆ แต่สำคัญอย่างยิ่งในธุรกิจโรงแรม จากการพิจารณาทั้งหมด แม้จะมีประสบการณ์ที่ไม่น่าประทับใจบางอย่าง แต่หากมีเหตุจำเป็นต้องกลับมาที่สิงคโปร์อีกครั้ง โรงแรมนี้ก็ มีความเป็นไปได้สำหรับการเข้าพักเพียง 1 คืนเท่านั้น เพื่อจุดประสงค์ของการพักค้างคืนชั่วคราวและไม่ได้คาดหวังบริการเต็มรูปแบบในเรื่องความสะอาดห้องพัก สำหรับราคา 180 SGD ต่อคืน ผู้เข้าพักย่อมคาดหวังมากกว่าห้องพักแคบๆ และอุปกรณ์ที่ไม่สะอาด หากคุณกำลังมองหาโรงแรมในสิงคโปร์และให้ความสำคัญกับความสะอาดและการบริการอย่างต่อเนื่อง การพิจารณาตัวเลือกอื่นๆ อาจเป็นทางเลือกที่ดีกว่า หรืออย่างน้อยที่สุด หากเลือกพักที่นี่ ก็ควรตรวจสอบอุปกรณ์ต่างๆ ภายในห้องอย่างละเอียดทันทีที่เข้าพัก.","Choosing the right accommodation during a trip can make or break a travel experience, and my two-night stay in Singapore left me with mixed feelings.
The positives I can see include the room amenities, which are quite complete. Even though I had to ask for more at the information counter, I can assume the hotel has the necessary essentials. At least I don't have to worry about missing basic necessities. Another significant saving is the free shuttle service to Paya Lebar MRT Station at 11:00 AM. This is a great option for those who don't rent a car or want to save on taxi fares. Furthermore, there are several bus lines around the hotel, making it relatively convenient to get around the city, even though the hotel is quite far from the city center.

Disappointing: Attention-grabbing details. However, my impression began to diminish with some seemingly overlooked details. First, the room size was quite small, considering the price per night. Travelers who prefer comfortable living space might find it a bit cramped. Water was another issue that required adjustment, as refilling it yourself was required on the 4th floor, and after 10:00 PM, refilling it was required downstairs. While not a major issue, it was a significant inconvenience. But perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the room cleaning policy. The hotel clearly stated that rooms would be cleaned for guests starting on the third night.
This meant that, for those staying for only two nights, like me, the room would not be cleaned at all throughout my stay. Even though the room wasn't cleaned during the first two nights, the hotel did replace the towels, which is crucial for a clean and comfortable stay.
The most disgusting aspect was the condition of the kettle in the room. There was a yellow stain on it. I tried to wipe it off, but it looked like a stubborn stain, similar to a nasty tooth tartar stain. This made me question why the room wasn't cleaned with a cleaning solution and thoroughly scrubbed the equipment that guests usually use.

Conclusion: Is it worth it? (For those who might return) In summary, despite the hotel's positive amenities, acceptable transportation, and the excellent service of the hotel staff, the overall experience was undermined by disappointing cleanliness standards and an inflexible room cleaning policy. The issue of stains on the kettle, in particular, demonstrated a lack of attention to small but crucial details in the hotel business. Overall, Despite some disappointing experiences, if we ever need to return to Singapore, this hotel is a viable option for a one-night stay. This is for temporary stays and doesn't require full service in terms of room cleanliness. For SGD 180 per night, guests expect more than a cramped room and unclean amenities. If you're looking for a hotel in Singapore and prioritize cleanliness and service, it might be a better idea to consider other options. Or, at the very least, thoroughly inspect the room before you arrive.",ibis Styles Singapore On Macpherson,3.7,en

Most value for my money western set lunches tend to be quite compromised is terms of quality, quantity and attention to detail, but not here.

Soup of the day was Pumpkin soup and was deliciously creamy and pumpkin sweet but yet not cloying. My starter of grilled broccoli looked plain but was perfectly grilled (not dry and retaining the juicy crunch) with the aroma of smokiness and seasoned with a touch of rosemary salt.

Both main courses of Fish and Chip and Char Grilled chicken may look ordinary but again I can't find fault with the perfectly deep fried crunchy batter and juicy fish, and the lovely chargrilled smokey tender juicy chicken.
My wife typically doesn't touch the fries but she almost finished all of it. No sauce required at all. This is how you do fries right.

Ann Siang Hill was originally known as Scott's Hill, after its original owner Charles Scott, who cultivated nutmegs and cloves in the area.[1] It was later sold to John Gemmill, a merchant and former auctioneer, and was renamed as Gemmill's Hill.[2] It was then sold to Chia in 1873 and renamed to Ann Siang Hill.[3]

Chia joined the British firm Boustead and Company in 1848. The company traded in natural resources, spices, coconut, tobacco, tin, tea and silk. After eight years on the job, Chia was promoted to chief produce storekeeper. He retired in 1890 after over 40 years of service in the company, and went into the timber business. He also became a partner of the firm Geok Teat and Company in 1863. After he became a wealthy landowner and one of the leading merchants of his time, he acquired both Gemmill's Hill and Mount Erskine.

The hill was known as qing shan ting to the local Chinese.[1] The early Chinese immigrants visited Ann Siang Hill when they wanted to send money home to their families in China, as it was the traditional site of remittance houses. Letter writers and calligraphers also had their businesses at the five-foot way of the shophouses to help the illiterate immigrants write letters home.

Most of the houses in Ann Siang Hill and along Ann Siang Road were built between 1903 and 1941. Ann Siang Road, which has elegantly restored shophouses today, was once the traditional home of clan associations and exclusive social clubs

Greenery abounds.
Many access points around the perimeter.
Provides a shortcut path between Maxwell and Chinatown.
Restrooms are non-existent.
Handicap possible, but there are stairs at several access points.
Final take.....nice teeny parklet.

The restaurant itself is spacious and comfortable, and even during peak hours, it wasn't overly crowded. This makes it an ideal spot for a relaxed meal without the hassle of long waits.

I'd previously enjoyed a resort stay at Marina Bay Sands, so I chose this hotel for its convenience. I have a Hilton AMEX card and booked it using my complimentary stay benefit. I could have also chosen the Conrad Orchard, but a friend told me it was on the outskirts of Orchard, so I chose this one. I'm an Honors Gold member, and I received an email upgrading me to an Executive Room the day before. A friend drove me home, but I had trouble finding the driveway, so I ended up in the underground parking lot. From there, I took the elevator to the front desk. I was able to choose my room number online in advance, but I accidentally chose the opposite side, even though I wanted the Orchard side. When I asked about the direction at check-in, they kindly explained to me the room I had chosen, not the Orchard side, but the building directly in front of me. They told me that there were no rooms available in this category on the Orchard side, but they offered a room one grade lower, on a higher floor, on the Orchard side, even though it didn't actually have access to the lounge. They kindly offered me a room with the lounge access, even though it didn't.

It's quite spacious, and while there isn't a huge selection of food, it's still a nice place to relax. || I had an early departure the next morning, so I skipped breakfast, but I received Hilton points for it. || On the day I was leaving, I discovered the driveway.

Dear Hilton Singapore Orchard Team,

I recently attended my company D&D at your hotel recently. Unfortunately, I found the catering experience to be well below the standard I have come to expect from the Hilton brand.

Specifically:

Dishes lacked flavor and freshness. Food was tasteless.

Temperature control was poor — some hot items were lukewarm on arrival.

Presentation felt rushed and unappealing for a venue of Hilton’s calibre.

I understand that banquet service has different logistics from restaurant dining, but even within those constraints, the quality on this occasion was disappointing. Given Hilton’s strong reputation, I was expecting a higher standard.

I hope this feedback will be shared with your banquet kitchen and event management teams so that future guests enjoy a dining experience that truly reflects the Hilton brand promise.

Sincerely,",,Hilton Singapore Orchard,4.5,

Their service consistently went above and beyond, and it made our time at the hotel not just comfortable, but truly memorable.

The entire Executive Lounge team deserves praise for their professionalism, warmth, and dedication to guest satisfaction. It’s rare to find such a consistently high level of service, and I hope their efforts are recognized and appreciated internally as much as they are by your guests.

First experience was ok, but kinda upset as we have to leave earlier due to a private function event thereafter.

3rd visit, I would say.... I will try to steer away from it.
Whenever you enter the compound, they will ask a series of questions (protocol) I'm fine with it. Then they will say, if furkids had an accident in the pool, there will be extra chargers. Oh yes..
Guess what, there was a pooping dog. Pooped into pool directly with owner scooping the poop out of water. The furkid walked over to another area to poop again, with the owner strolling in and out of pool, hand scooping poop out. Ya, he left his furkid in the pool all the time. All other owners carried their dogs out of pool, some went into the deep pools but unfortunately it's too deep for smaller dogs.

Nothing was done to clean up pool.. we all idle by some 10mins before deciding to go off

Expect to get wet from waist down.
----

Went there on a weekday afternoon. It was non peak and there were in total 5 dogs including my own. (I think the nearby dog boarding brings the dogs there too)

Gate only opened when the time slot is open. Staff did a check on the vaccination record before letting me enter.

He did not offer a life vest for my dog till I asked for it. Another guest also didn't know till she saw me asking for it. Maybe good to inform/ask guest upfront.
(My dog fell into a pool as she run around excitedly but managed to climb out herself. So do get the life vest for ur dog at the start).

Staff was helpful to give me tips as it was my first time there and my dog was freaking out in the water. He also gave some treats too, which really helped. Thanks!

Pool area:
- Main pool: Shallow waters (mid-calf level) which slopes into deeper water (waist level).
- Shallow water area is quite a good big area for dogs that don't swim but yet can play and jumping around the water.
- Second smaller, deeper pool is for big dogs to swim in.
- Toys and floats are available for them to play.

Facilities:
- Changing stalls is literally 3 tents with curtains that do not shut properly as well.
- Shower area is open area with taps and shower heads. A bit hard to control my dog in the open so I gave up halfway.
- Drying area. It's outside the pool area, along the common walkway, just 2 plugs there. I can imagine if there's a crowd you won't be able to use it.
- Visibly see algae/green stuff floating around the base of the pool. Not for fussy owners.

I guess I would head back again cos my dog was more water confident at the end of the session. She has fun in the shallow waters. The shower and drying area was not optimal so I won't shower her there.",,Wag & Wild,4.5,

Nous sommes actuellement dans cet hôtel pour 8 nuits. Nous l’avons réservé pour 3 raisons (chaîne d’hôtel française, faire fonctionner nos entreprises et utiliser notre compte All).

Nous avons récupéré notre chambre hier vers 17h et avons rencontré 2 premiers problèmes:
- Nos points rewards qui avaient été décomptés lors de la réservation n’ont pas été décomptés à notre arrivée. Après vérification, il a fallu retourner à la réception pour se faire rembourser la différence.
- La chambre était sale (poubelle non vidée, cheveux sur le sol dans la salle de bain, traces de liquide-vaisselle dans le lavabo). Nous avons demandé à la réception, photos à l’appui (ci-jointes) de venir nettoyer la chambre.

Nous sommes partis retrouver notre famille et lorsque nous sommes rentrés vers 21h30, rien n’avait été fait… Nous sommes retournés à la réception pour demander à ce que le nécessaire soit fait! Une personne est venue à 21h45. Nous sommes avec un bébé de 11 mois, je vous laisse imaginer la situation…

Ce matin, après avoir fait quelques pas dans la chambre, nous avions les pieds noirs. Souhaitant être poli et non insistant, j’ai appuyé sur l’alarme pour que la chambre soit nettoyée aujourd’hui.
En rentrant ce soir à 21h30, l’alarme était toujours activée et la chambre non faite!
Nous avons dû retourner à la réception une nouvelle fois et là on m’explique que c’est normal car le ménage est fait tous les deux jours mais qu’ils sont désolés de la situation et que le nécessaire sera fait demain!

Enfin, si nous voulons être vraiment pointilleux et pénibles, notre chambre ne ressemble pas à celle de la photo lors de la réservation, évidemment la plus vieillotte. De plus, il y a de la bande-cache (pour faire les peintures) au plafond dans la salle de bain, de la peinture sur le sommier et le sol…

Le séjour risque d’être long pour nous…","Hello,

We are currently staying at this hotel for 8 nights. We booked it for three reasons (French hotel chain, to run our businesses, and to use our All account).

We checked into our room yesterday around 5:00 PM and encountered two initial problems:
- Our rewards points, which had been deducted when we booked, were not deducted upon arrival. After checking, we had to return to reception to get the difference refunded.
- The room was dirty (trash not emptied, hair on the bathroom floor, dish soap stains in the sink). We asked reception, with photos attached, to come and clean the room.

We left to meet up with family, and when we returned around 9:30 PM, nothing had been done… We returned to reception to ask for the necessary cleaning! Someone came at 9:45 PM. We're with an 11-month-old baby, so you can imagine the situation...

This morning, after walking a few steps in the room, our feet were black. Wanting to be polite and not pushy, I pressed the alarm to have the room cleaned today.
When I got back this evening at 9:30 p.m., the alarm was still on and the room wasn't cleaned!
We had to go back to reception again, and they explained to me that this was normal because housekeeping is done every other day, but that they apologized for the situation and that the necessary work would be done tomorrow!

Finally, if we want to be really picky and annoying, our room doesn't look like the one in the photo when we booked, obviously the oldest one. Furthermore, there's masking tape (used for painting) on the ceiling in the bathroom, paint on the bed base and floor...

🧹 Cleanliness & Pest Control This was the most concerning aspect of our stay. Despite deep cleaning, we repeatedly encountered cockroaches throughout our stay.

I have booked a total of 28 days (a month) here at Dusit Thani because of the reputation and i am not disappointed.

Concierge Team- From the start of my journey, i was able to deposit my bags and baggages here. And do note, i had 16 different baggages, the concierge did not merely indicate my name and contact number, but they took the effort to count every single one of them and pack them nicely, which shows the level of accountability the concierge team had.

Front Desk- Prior to arrival, the front desk is able to communicate with me and inform me of the steps before check in so checking in was a breeze, in fact they are also very responsive in ensuring that my month’s stay at Dusit will be smooth sailing. Kudos to Salwa, director of front office for ensuring this is possible. I am highly impressed.

Rooms - Next, the view of my room is phenomenal, imagine waking up to the sunrise and come home to an amazing sunset every single day. The rooms are spacious and one of the best i have stayed so far. There is also an app where you can request for your necessities which i find it extremely useful.

Food & Beverage (F&B) - The most important department in ensuring a smooth experience. Throughout my month’s stay at Dusit, not a single day was dull, but with the warm greetings from the team from F&B during breakfast and chef curated menu specially done for my stay, i could say that they have went above and beyond to ensure that everyday i have something different, something special and always serving me passionately and genuinely during my stay. I am highly impressed and i can ensure you that with this great team, your stay would not be dull, but memorable and exceptional.

Next, as i was preparing to leave for the next hotel for another month of staycation, i would like to compliment Mr Guna from the concierge team and Oliver from the front desk department for their star studded experience.

As i mentioned, i have 16 different baggages to transport to my next hotel, the moment my request was sent through the app, Mr Guna was already at my door step ready to transport my baggage to the vehicle.

And for Oliver, i would like to compliment and encourage fellow Hoteliers, that he is one impressive individual.

Knowing that Mr Guna is assisting me with my baggages, he went above and beyond to offer assistance to load my baggages into the vehicle and offering suggestions on how to best fit into the vehicle.

This is something that is definitely not necessary in his job scope, but he did it. Because he doesn’t see concierge and front office as different department, but One Dusit. Because he lives and breathes Dusit Thani and definitely embedded and reflects the warm, gracious hospitality that Dusit is known for.

Next, for the housekeeping team, they are always exceptional with their service, ensuring spotless areas in their cleaning and surprise me once in awhile :)

Lastly, the only area that i had not explored is the Golf course, seeing people play golf infront of my eyes but not able to try is definitely sad but i hope i had the opportunity in the future.

It is day 28 night right now, and I am sitting in my room typing this compliment for the hotel. They say habit takes a few months to form, i would say that Dusit was a love at first sight, and i will definitely miss each and every encounter i had in Dusit.

Great Job team, till the next time that we meet.

Very Pleased Dusit Thani Guest

Our 2 rooms whilst not interconnecting ( doesn’t seem common in Singapore) were very near to each other on the same floor which was great. The bedrooms felt like a bit of a lottery. One was fine, the other had malfunctioning air con and smelled really bad. Not sure what the stench was ; but coupled with the broken aircon made it an uncomfortable night. Thankfully we were moving on to changi airport early next morning. Annoyingly, the message we left with reception the night before about booking a large taxi wasn’t relayed to the concierge so we ended up wedged into a tiny cab with all our luggage & an angry opinionated taxi driver who was convinced we were American & spent the thankfully  short taxi ride listing the myriad ways Singapore >USA.",,Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore,4.4,

On 13 June 2025, my home caught fire early in the morning. My girlfriend and I barely escaped, losing nearly all our belongings within minutes. We were in shock, with nothing but our pyjamas, a partially burnt passport, and our three pets (a hamster and two guinea pigs) — who we managed to save. My girlfriend was admitted to NUH A&E, and a friend kindly booked a room at this hotel for me, as it was nearby. The purpose was simple: to briefly shelter the pets while I returned to the hospital.

When I arrived, visibly distressed, I was greeted by a staff member named Audrey. Despite our clear emergency and the hotel having been informed by phone in advance, I was coldly told “no pets” — without any effort to understand the context or offer a humane solution. I explained that I just needed a few hours of safe space to regroup and return to the hospital, that I was willing to pay extra cleaning fees, and that the animals were secured in proper carriers. Still, the response was robotic and dismissive.

There was no offer of water, support, or even the simplest courtesy like “are you okay?” — only repeated policy enforcement. In contrast, every other organisation we dealt with in the aftermath — from SCDF to our landlord, even telcos and delivery companies — responded with empathy and flexibility. This hotel was the only place that treated us without basic decency.

I fully understand policies exist. But compassion should, at times, override rules, especially in extreme and rare circumstances. I left feeling more shaken than when I arrived, and the stress worsened the health of our pets that day.

If you’re looking for a hotel that treats guests with humanity — especially in emergencies — I cannot recommend this one. Our experience stands out in contrast to the overwhelming kindness we received from everyone else.",,Citadines Science Park Singapore,4.1,

It might feel cramped if you're traveling as a couple with multiple large bags.🛍️ Groceries: There’s no supermarket nearby within easy walking distance. If you’re planning to cook, buy groceries before arrival.🚨 Emergency Sirens: The hotel is near a hospital, so you may occasionally hear emergency vehicles passing by.🚪 Missing Essentials: No tissue boxes, razors, bathrobes, or slippers were provided — minor details, but noticeable for the price.🚫 No Balcony Access: While the room has tall windows and a nice view, there’s no actual access to a balcony, which may disappoint guests expecting one.🛁 No Bathtub: Considering the room’s price point, some guests may expect a bathtub, but only a standing shower is provided.---Final Thoughts:The Loft Room offers a peaceful and stylish stay with great lighting and a cozy atmosphere. While compact and lacking a few expected amenities, it’s still a solid choice if you’re traveling light and appreciate good design.

Lets dive in!

Rooms:
We managed to see inside the rooms but felt that its actually similar to every hotel that we had been to before. So its a 5 star nonetheless

Service:
There are some small downsides where staff, when approached, didnt even smile but looked disgruntled.. but again, maybe its due to the heat of the area. We gona give a 5 as the rest of the staff we met, made our day with smiles and professionalism. Lunch was sumptuous but unfortunately not halal.. so we were quite challenged.. we had sushi and salad

Location:
Slightly further to end of the road. If u had been to Newater, then its a similar direction just a deviate at certain junction. The whole place has an aura of exclusivity..

We really enjoyed our time here and if the food had a halal section or fully halal, it would be the best actually.

All in all, we would recommend to stay here, for u to unwind away from the hassle and dazzle of Singapore, within Singapore. Just 1 downside of the whole place, u will need to arrange transport in/out as there is no public buses/trains ready yet.

아고다에서는 좋은 리뷰가 많아서 기대하며 예약했습니다.

임신한 와이프와 태교여행으로 싱가포르에 가기로 해서 1박에 20만원 좀 안되는 가격에 예약했는데 처음 숙소에 도착할때부터 이게 맞는지 계속 의문이 들더군요.
리조트 건물과 주변 구조물들은 90년대에서 멈춰 있는거 같고 방에 들어왔을때는 경악을 금치 못했습니다.
아주 오래된듯한 방 내부와 냉장고는 낡아서 칠이 벗겨지고 벗겨진부분은 다 녹슬어 있었습니다.

방 에어컨도 대체 청소를 언제 했는지 먼지가 가득하고 온도 조절기는 무슨 80-90년대에도 사용했을까 싶은 말도안되는 다이얼식 온도 조절기에다가 아무리 에어컨을 켜놔도 방이 절대 시원해지지 않습니다.
프론트에 방이 덥다고 얘기하니 잠시후에 기사님 같은 분이 오시더니 레이저 온도계로 온도 체크 하시는데 에어컨 나오는 부분은 16도인데 침대가 25도 방바닥이 23도가 측정되는 이게 무슨 말도 안되는 어메이징한 현상이 관측되더군요.

그러고는 잠시 기다리라더니 다른 직원이 선풍기 한대를 들고 와서 한다는 말이 리조트에서 에어컨은 중앙제어라서 미니멈 온도가 정해져있고 다른 방도 전부 같은 상황이라는데 이러면 대체 온도조절기가 무슨 의미가 있나 싶네요.

그리고 가져온 선풍기는 진짜 가관이었습니다.
와이프는 임산부라서 하나하나 조심해야되는데 선풍기에 먼지가 쌓이고 쌓여 무슨 사용하면 폐병걸리게 생겼는데, 제가 이걸 지금 쓰라고 가져온거냐니까 작동 잘된다면서 켜길레 제가 바로 다시 끄고 이거 먼지 이렇게 쌓인걸 임산부가 쓰라고 가져온거냐니까 하나남은거 가져온거라고 어쩔수 없다 하길래 그냥 가라고 했습니다.
진짜 어이가 없었습니다.

방에는 기본 물이 2개있었는데 다 마시고 방 정리 하는 사람에게 물을 더 달라고 하니 물은 프론트에 얘기하래서 프론트에 얘기하니 1,7,8층에 식수 받는 곳이 있어서 거기서 채워 마셔야 한답니다.
저는 제가 잘못 이해했구나 싶어 프론트에 직접가서 물을 더 달라하니 숙박기간 전체동안만 2개 제공해주고 그 이상은 직접 떠다 마셔야한다 하더라구요.
이게 1박에 20만원 가까이 하는 숙소의 서비스 인가요? 참고로 처음 체크인 할때 저런 말 한마디도 해주지 않았습니다. 그래서 저희는 그냥 물 사먹었습니다.

수질은 진짜 놀랐습니다.
처음에 샤워기 수압이 약해서 저희가 혹시 몰라서 챙겨온 필터 샤워기로 교체하고 사용했더니 하루만에 필터가 변색이 일어나더라구요.
하다하다 수질도 저러니 이제는 화도 안나더라구요.
그냥 돈 날렸구나 생각만 들었습니다.

저희 부부 방은 2층 이었는데 침대도 싱글 2개있는 방을 주길래 더블사이즈 침대 없냐니까 방이 다 차서 없다고 침대를 직접 옮겨서 붙여서 사용하라 했습니다.
방이 2층이라 낮은데 바깥을 보고 싶어도 밖에서 사람들이 고개 돌리면 저희방 다 보이더라구요 창문에 속커튼이 없어 암막 커튼(?)을 쳐야 해서 지내는동안 창문 밖 풍경은 하나도 못봤습니다.

건물과 방에서는 무슨 퀘퀘한 냄새도 나고 아침에 일어나니 개미 보이고 저희 부부 둘다 개미 물린것으로 생각되는 벌레물림 자국이 생겼습니다.

다시 얘기하지만 1박에 20만원 가까이 지불했습니다.

정말 최악중 가장 최악이었습니다.
싱가포르에 처음 오는데 여기 전 숙소는 비슷한 가격에 여기와는 비교도 안되는 룸 컨디션, 서비스, 수질상태, 위생, 청결 어느것 하나 여기와는 비교불가 수준으로 좋았습니다.
싱가포르는 선진국에 깔끔하다는 얘기들은 여기 오기전까지는 정말 좋은 경험하다가 여기 오자마자 다 박살났습니다.

다음에 싱가포르에 또 오게된다면 그때는 절대 센토사에 숙박을 안할거에요.
차라리 다른곳에 숙소를 잡고 다른 교통수단으로 센토사에 들어오겠습니다.","There really isn't a single thing that's good about this place. Everything about it is terrible.
I had high expectations because of the many good reviews on Agoda.

My pregnant wife and I decided to go to Singapore for a prenatal care trip, so we booked a room for just under 200,000 won per night. From the moment we arrived, I couldn't help but question whether we were getting what we paid for.
The resort building and surrounding structures felt like they were stuck in the 90s, and I was shocked when I entered the room.
The interior of the room felt very old, and the refrigerator was worn, with peeling paint and rust everywhere.

The air conditioner in the room was so dusty that I don't know when it was last cleaned. The thermostat was a ridiculous dial-type thermostat that looked like it might have been used in the 80s or 90s. No matter how hard I turned it on, the room never cooled down. I told the front desk that the room was hot, and a technician came over shortly after and checked the temperature with a laser thermometer. The air conditioning was at 16 degrees, but the bed was at 25 degrees, and the floor was at 23 degrees. It was an incredible, unbelievable phenomenon.

Then, after telling me to wait a moment, another employee came back with a fan. He said the resort's air conditioning is centrally controlled, so there's a set minimum temperature, and all the other rooms are the same. So, what's the point of a thermostat?

And the fan they brought was truly a sight to behold.
My wife is pregnant, so we have to be careful with everything. The fan kept accumulating dust, and if I used it, I'd probably get lung disease. I asked if they brought it just for me to use, and they said it worked fine and turned it on. I immediately turned it off. I asked if they brought it with all this dust for a pregnant woman to use, and they said they had brought the last one and there was nothing they could do about it, so I just told them to leave.

I was absolutely dumbfounded.

There were two bottles of water in the room, but after drinking them all, I asked the housekeeper for more. They told me to ask the front desk for water, and I had to go to the water dispensers on the 1st, 7th, and 8th floors to refill them.
I realized I'd misunderstood, so I went to the front desk and asked for more. They said they only provided two bottles for the entire stay and that I had to fetch any more bottles myself.
Is this typical service for a place that costs nearly 200,000 won per night? Incidentally, they didn't even mention that when we first checked in. So we just bought water.

The water quality was truly surprising.
At first, the shower pressure was weak, so we replaced it with a filter showerhead we'd brought just in case. But within a day, the filter had discolored.
The water quality was so bad that I wasn't even angry anymore.
I just felt like I'd wasted my money.

My husband and I's room was on the second floor, and they gave us a room with two single beds. When I asked if they had a double bed, they said they had no double beds and that we had to move the beds together ourselves.
Our room was on the second floor, so it was low, and even if we wanted to look outside, people outside could see right through our room if they turned their heads. There were no inner curtains on the windows, so we had to use blackout curtains, so we couldn't see anything outside during our stay.

The building and room smelled musty, and when we woke up in the morning, we saw ants, and both my husband and I had bug bites that we thought were ant bites.

I'll say it again: we paid nearly 200,000 won per night.

It was truly the worst of the worst.
This was my first time in Singapore, and the previous accommodations here were comparable in price to this one. The room condition, service, water quality, hygiene, and cleanliness were all incomparable.
The stories about Singapore being a developed country and being clean were great until I arrived here, but they were all shattered the moment I arrived.

Next time I come to Singapore, I will absolutely not stay in Sentosa. I'd rather find accommodation elsewhere and use another means of transportation to get to Sentosa.",Siloso Beach Resort,4.1,en

I stayed in one of the cheapest, windowless rooms. The bed was clean, large and firm, I found it comfortable and more than acceptable. The bathroom was spacious and, if anything, the water pressure was too high and the water sometimes too hot! Service was very good. There was an iron and ironing board in the room, a kettle and pitcher was provided, with some basic tea / coffee supplies. There was a small desk that would just about be usable if you sat on the end of the bed.

The decor is, admittedly, poor in some places. Paint appears patchy and the lifts are quite old. There are things stacked in the corridors etc. The corridors were being renovated when I was staying, which was being done until 2200h and was occasionally disturbing. However, if you want a cheap room, I found it to be very clean, perhaps aside from some hair left in the shower drain that I noticed after I'd been there a few days.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Booking and checking in/out was so easy, and during my stay all the staff were kind.

The location is great if you are attending NUS or INSEAD, which are close enough to commute. West Coast Park is quite nice but obviously the CBD and most major tourist areas are over the other side of the island. By taxi it might be USD 20-30 each way (or more in rush hour), so perhaps best to stay on the East Coast unless you have time to use the public transport.

The area felt safe, many tourists, schools and residential areas. There are many public transport connections stopping in the area to take you most major places. There is a 24h 7-11 close by and some vending machines outside the hotel. The 7-11 allows you to microwave food any that you bought there so you can get a cheap hot meal. The restaurants around the area are also well-known and recommended by locals, there is a real mix of cuisines and some are quite reasonably priced.

My one major issue was that there was a peephole in my door but no cover, so the light from the corridor would light the room enough to stop me sleeping, so I had to use an eye mask. Perhaps a sticky-note would have done the job.",,The Quay Hotel West Coast,3.7,

Hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,Isaac Chan,42,2387,5,"一家4人住了8日7夜,CP值高,地方十分方便,對面是一個大商場Vivo City,有一個超大超級市場補給,3分鐘到巴士站

這裏只會在入住時候提供一次性樽裝水,之後不會再提供樽裝水,我明白自來水可直接飲用,但是我不會給小朋友直接飲用自來水,畢竟去旅行怕水土不服,而房間服務為每兩天/次,更換房間及掉垃圾,但沒有清潔地板,這點很失望

個人覺得奇怪,首先水不是每日或者兩天提供一次,而是入住計算只會提供一次,如果客人住一天又是提供一次,住兩天又是提供一次,那我住8天不是很不公平嗎？我去其他亞洲地區旅遊,如泰國日本等,都沒有這樣的情況,水在新加坡是不是很貴？

其他住客亦有評論反映這一點,就是房間廁所有異味,個人建議先利用廁所旁的花灑沖洗去水位置,另外廁所沖水水壓也有點差,這點也希望酒店注意及重視,畢竟影響個人衛生及健康

入住期間有兩晚短暫沒有冷氣,但通知前台半小時左右就可以解決,我不知道是不是節省成本而關閉部分設備

三床房間,但第三張床是窗台加建的窗台床,但床褥也可以改善,不是用又薄又硬的床褥,由如木板,晚上轉身睡覺還有聲響

整體酒店地理位置很好,但房間問題希望正視,直接影響住客,如果介紹其他國家地區分店,個人會因以上房間問題影響選擇","Our family of four stayed for 8 days and 7 nights. The value is excellent and the location is very convenient. Across from Vivo City, a large shopping mall with a large supermarket, is a 3-minute walk from the bus stop.

They only provide a single-use bottle of water upon check-in and no more bottled water after that. I understand that tap water is drinkable, but I wouldn't let my children drink it directly from the tap, after all, I'm afraid they might get acclimatized when traveling. Room service is every two days, with room changes and trash removal, but no floor cleaning, which is very disappointing.

I find it strange that water isn't provided daily or every two days, but only once per stay. If guests stay one day and then two days and then again, wouldn't it be unfair for me to stay for 8 days? I haven't had this experience in other Asian countries like Thailand and Japan. Is water really expensive in Singapore?

Other guests have also commented on the unpleasant odor in the toilet. I personally recommend using the showerhead next to the toilet to flush the drain. The flush pressure was also a bit weak, which I hope the hotel will address and address, as it affects personal hygiene and health.

The air conditioning was temporarily out for two nights during our stay, but after notifying the front desk, it was fixed within half an hour. I wonder if they're shutting down some of the equipment to save costs.

The room had three beds, but the third bed was a window sill bed built into the windowsill. The mattress could also be improved, not the thin, hard mattress that felt like a wooden board and made noises when turning over in bed.

Overall, the hotel has a great location, but the room issues need to be addressed, as they directly impact guests. If I were to recommend a branch in another country, these room issues would personally influence my choice.",Travelodge Harbourfront,4,en

Without even asking us, the front desk just handed us two key cards for two single rooms. When we expressed confusion, we thought they might not know we are a couple, so we emphasized our relationship. But they just casually replied that the room type we booked was no longer available and they could offer breakfast as compensation. Seriously? We booked a double bed room — not two single rooms! And they didn’t even bother to ask if we were okay with the change — just made the decision for us!

We refused to accept it, and only after insisting did they finally give us a double bed room. That’s when we realized the hotel actually did have double bed rooms available — they just wanted guests to help them get rid of their hard-to-sell rooms first. This kind of trick is outrageous and unacceptable.

What made it even worse was the front desk saying, “This room is even better than the one you originally booked,” like they were doing us a favor.

BTW the bathroom in the room we finally got had a glass door that wouldn’t even close properly – it stayed wide open with a visible gap.

MRTやバス停が近く、ビボシティやスーパー、コンビニにもアクセスしやすいのは大きな魅力です。Wi-Fiも安定して速く、ストレスはありませんでした。

プールはシンプルながら清潔で十分。タオルも常に整っていて気持ちよく使えました。朝食会場ではスタッフの方々が丁寧に掃除や配膳をしてくださり、品数は多くはないですが、落ち着いた雰囲気の中で毎朝気持ちよく食事ができました。

フロントや清掃スタッフの方々もとても感じがよく、笑顔での挨拶や気配りに、全体を通して丁寧さが感じられました。小学生の息子も「また来たい」と言っていて、家族の思い出に残る滞在になりました。

一方で、いくつかの点では説明が少なく、少し戸惑う場面もありました。
たとえば、部屋の「緑の掃除ボタン」が掃除希望なのか、環境配慮で掃除不要のサインなのかが分かりづらく、何度か迷いました。また、ミネラルウォーターが毎日提供されるのか初日だけなのかも明示されていなかったため、スーパーでの買い物に少し影響がありました（実際は初日のみの提供でした）。

朝食では毎回突然「部屋番号は？」と聞かれましたが、もし申告制であるならチェックイン時や会場に案内があれば、よりスムーズで気持ちよく利用できたと思います。
また、12時のレイトチェックアウトもありがたいサービスなので、これも最初に一言いただけると安心感が増すと感じました。

とはいえ、これらは些細な点であり、改善を期待してあえて書きました。コストパフォーマンス、立地、スタッフの対応すべてを考えると、本当に素晴らしいホテルだったと思います。滞在中のホスピタリティに心より感謝しています。ありがとうございました。","My family and I stayed for six nights and had a truly comfortable stay. The location was excellent, just two MRT stops from Chinatown and a five-minute walk from the monorail to Sentosa. I also took the MRT to and from the airport, which took just over an hour.

The proximity to the MRT and bus stops, along with easy access to VivoCity, supermarkets, and convenience stores, were a major draw. The Wi-Fi was stable and fast, making it a hassle-free experience.

The pool was simple but clean and adequate. Towels were always readily available, making it a pleasant experience. The breakfast staff were diligent in cleaning and serving the food. Although the selection was limited, the relaxing atmosphere allowed us to enjoy our breakfast every morning.

The front desk and cleaning staff were also very friendly, with smiles and attentive service throughout. My son, who is in elementary school, said he wanted to come back, making this a memorable stay for our family.

However, there were some aspects that were not fully explained, which left us feeling a little confused at times.
For example, I was confused several times as to whether the ""green cleaning button"" in my room indicated a request for cleaning or a signal that cleaning was not required due to environmental considerations. It also wasn't clear whether mineral water was provided daily or only on the first day, which slightly affected my shopping at the supermarket (it was actually only provided on the first day).

At breakfast, I was suddenly asked ""What's your room number?"" every time. If it was a self-report system, I think it would have been smoother and more comfortable if they had informed me at check-in or in the dining area.

Also, the late check-out at 12:00 is a very appreciated service, so I felt a mention of this at the outset would have given me more peace of mind.

However, these are minor points, and I have mentioned them in the hope that they will be improved. Considering the value for money, location, and staff service, I think this was a truly excellent hotel. I am truly grateful for the hospitality during my stay.

I also really appreciated the strong air conditioning in the room, which is something I always value, especially in hot and humid countries like Singapore. I was assigned a room on the 6th floor, and while I didn’t have time to use the pool, I liked that it was just a 10-second walk from my room.

That said, there were a few downsides. The room was quite small, so I wouldn’t recommend it for more than one person—it could feel cramped. Another issue was the shower room, which had a bad smell coming from the vent every night, making it unpleasant.

The breakfast was mediocre—nothing special but still better than having no breakfast at all. However, it was very crowded every morning, with limited indoor seating available.

The shampoo and shower gel are nice. |But there are no regular sockets in the bathroom, only for a razor, so I had to dry my hair in the kitchen with a hair dryer. |And in general, the sockets are very inconveniently located around the room. But there is one adapter for European sockets. | There were scales in the room, very convenient when packing luggage. | A small gym and a pool outside, but it is purely for soaking, you can't swim there. | I didn't like the breakfast at all: very meager, only 10 dishes, and 7 of them are Asian cuisine. Average pastries. Disgustingly sweet store-bought yogurts. | The reception staff is not very professional: they said that it would not be a problem to leave the zoo at night after a night safari, like there are plenty of taxis there. In fact, at midnight there are no taxis at all and you need to call and order one, or through apps. | A taxi from the airport costs about 35 Singapore dollars.

バスタブ付きのお部屋でベッドも広い快適なホテルです。
●館内設備
フロントは日本のホテル同様の雰囲気です。住所記入やデボジットは不要でした。
Wi-fiは高速で快適に使えました。
●お部屋
とにかく広いの一言です。
2泊した中では虫には遭遇しませんでした。匂いは若干古いような匂いがしましたが、許容範囲内でした。
欠点は音問題です。廊下の音が部屋にも響いてきます。特に扉の開閉音がかなり響くので夜中には少し気になります。
また、金曜日の夜などは下の屋台で食事をしながら騒いでる人が多くいるため、部屋によっては騒音に感じる場合があります。
エアコンは各部屋で温度調整・風量調整ができる個別エアコンタイプです。
コンセントは海外プラグ対応で日本のコンセントも対応しておりました。ドライヤーも引き出しの中にあります。
●水回り
シンガポールでは珍しくバスタブがあります。シャワーと蛇口の切り替えが少し硬かったです。
浄水器がついているため、安全に水道水を飲むことができます。
●立地
カトン地区の北部に位置しており、MRTも徒歩圏内のためアクセスしやすいです。
ホテルに隣接して複数の屋台があるので、食事には困らないです。
また、チャンギ空港行きの早朝のバスも通る道沿いのため、早朝フライトでも間に合います。","This is a review from a Japanese guest.
Room: Deluxe Queen
View: Yes
This is a comfortable hotel with a bathtub and a spacious bed.
●Hotel Facilities
The front desk has the same atmosphere as a Japanese hotel. No address information or deposit required.
The Wi-Fi was fast and easy to use.
●Room
The room is simply spacious.
During my two nights, I didn't encounter any insects. There was a slightly stale smell, but it was within acceptable limits.
The only drawback is the noise. Sounds from the hallway carry into the room. Doors opening and closing are particularly loud, which can be a bit annoying in the middle of the night.
Also, on Friday nights, there are many noisy people eating at the food stall below, so it can be quite noisy in some rooms.
The air conditioning is individual, with temperature and fan speed controls for each room.
The outlets are compatible with international plugs and are also compatible with Japanese outlets. There's also a hair dryer in the drawer.
●Bathroom
There's a bathtub, which is rare in Singapore. The shower and faucet were a bit stiff to switch between.
The hotel comes with a water filter, so the tap water is safe to drink.
●Location
Located in the northern part of Katong, the hotel is easily accessible within walking distance of the MRT.
There are several food stalls adjacent to the hotel, so you'll have no trouble finding something to eat.
It's also located along the same road as the early morning bus to Changi Airport, so you can make it in time for an early morning flight.",Hotel 81 Tristar,3.9,en

Hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,ConSTANtine The Man,1,1093,3,"We had an okay stay here during our July trip to Singapore. Main complaint = bad service and filth.
PROS:
1) The location is pretty good. It takes less than 10 minutes to get to Paya Lebar MRT station and the PLQ mall. There are tons of food options around the area, and there’s even a convenience store by the entrance of the hotel.
2) The room we had was pretty spacious. We had lots of space to mobilize easily and open our luggage.

CONS:
1) The service is not very good here. I have multiple experiences to support my argument. FIRST, the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were not greeted at all by the receptionist (we greeted him, and there was no response) who seemed Asian and a bit old, with a frowny, annoying face. The first thing he said was, “All passports (in a rude, commanding intonation).” No good morning, no “how are you doing?”. At first I thought, oh, he must be tired since it was midnight and a graveyard shift. But I realized that this should NOT be an excuse. In the tons of hotels we’ve stayed at in the past, even at midnight, we are always greeted. It’s basic customer service. It wouldn’t hurt to say good morning or SMILE at least. SECOND, we specifically asked for our room to be cleaned and for the bedsheets, towels, etc. to be replaced (we hung the tag on the doorknob). However, when we came back, it was not cleaned at all. Nothing was replaced or changed. We called the front desk afterwards to clean our room. They did not apologize at all for their shortcoming, and all they said was, “okay we will send housekeeping [end of call].” It took about 1.5 hours for them to arrive. However, the housekeeping staff who helped us throughout our stay was the one polite staff in this entire hotel. This staff helped us with our requests, and was very helpful. THIRD, we kinda felt like ghosts throughout our stay. Whenever we entered or exited, the front desk staff just continued gossiping and chatting while staring at their computers, completely ignoring us. When we checked out, they did not thank us for staying with them. Maybe it was a certain batch of staff? Idk.
2) There were some large brown spots of dirt on the bathtub. It looked like it wasn’t cleaned for a while. It was kinda disgusting, as it looked like it could possibly be💩.
3) There were inconsiderate guests shouting and yelling at the hallway at night, making it quite difficult to relax/sleep.

Hmmm, mainly, it seems like Hotel 81 Tristar has a problem with a certain batch of front desk staff. Consider training these guys to at least have some basic customer service skills. This hotel has potential due its pros, but consider solving your cons. Would’ve wanted to stay here again especially due to its location, but the cons made us not want to stay here again.",,Hotel 81 Tristar,3.9,

Hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,stephen Ost,5,5266,2,"What a woeful experience. We booked a discounted ""Deluxe Queen"" room - 30% off apparently. This wasn't worth it, even at that discount. I think I'd be physically ill if I'd been stupid enough to pay full price.

Firstly, the check in experience. Rarely have I encountered such unfriendly and unhelpful staff in a front of house role. There was a lot of talking between check in staff but only the bare minimum of communication to me. ""you have booking?"", ""Sign here"", ""Details here"", ""Pay this"". I suspect they were having trouble finding a room (which might explain some of the issues with the actual room). Despite being sent emails encouraging me to self check in, that was a waste of time as the machine just tells you to go to the check in counter anyway where they ask you again for all the same information I already provided online. When I mentioned this the check in person completely ignored me, no sorry, just pretended I didn't speak.

Then the room. No seating as shown in the images of the room. Just a desk chair and a poufé. Coffee 'included' is instant coffee, not a coffee pod machine. The room decor is very tired and dated and the carpet is stained. Then the worst, the bathroom! A shower curtain! Seriously? When you shower, the water is free to run all over the bathroom floor. I had to put down all the spare towels and floor mat just to stop it running everywhere. Bars either side of the toilet so you have to dislocate your shoulder to get to the toilet holder and to wipe your backside. Clearly this is a disabled room, yet no mention of that to us. The silicone around the base of the toilet is quite unsightly. Really not that hard to put silicone on neatly if you actually care.

I am glad I didn't need to go near the breakfast room. That was jam packed. People spilled out into the foyer to eat and there was still a line up.

Pool is very average, looks very tired. Entrance has no ramp so one has to lug luggage up steps. And no staff assistance available.

I usually avoid writing negative reviews, but my experience at Hotel Miramar left me with no choice.

Despite having a confirmed and prepaid booking through Agoda, my reservation was not honored when I arrived. The staff informed me that the hotel was fully booked and could not accommodate us — even though we were willing to pay again. I later confirmed with Booking.com that the hotel was indeed full at that time, which suggests that our reservation was either mishandled or overbooked.

The worst part was being made to wait in the lobby for over 6 hours. My friend, who has back issues, suffered intense pain from sitting for such a long period. The staff did not offer any proper solution or comfort during this time.

Due to this unacceptable treatment and my friend's deteriorating health condition, we were forced to change our travel plans and return home early to seek medical attention. It was a disappointing and distressing end to what was supposed to be a relaxing trip.

Serviced accommodation ,FALSE,FALSE,Arlisa Hamza,3,128,3,"I stayed at Citadines Connect Rochester for a period of almost three months. I would describe the stay as overall pleasant, however, there have been multiple issues throughout it that I'd like to share.

Starting off with the room, I stayed at the Premier room on the 7th floor. The space is utilized incredibly well, however the ventilation and lack of air flow made it, at times, almost unlivable for me. The lack of windows and an odor coming from the bathroom (shower) had me lose sleep and avoid my room more often than not, especially nearing the end of my stay. Staff was contacted on the issue and while they really tried to help (both engineers and cleaning staff), the smell stayed persistent. Cooking was also very useful in theory - but any sort of food smell would fill up the room for hours due to bad ventilation. Otherwise, the room was spacious and comfortable.

Secondly, I have a few comments on the services and staff. While everyone has been friendly and helpful, I have been disturbed with phone calls to an alarming degree. These calls were mainly regarding room cleaning - though I was very clear on having my room cleaned every other day, and whenever the room was on do not disturb, to not go in. This wasn't respected and I was called over and over to confirm room cleaning. Further I have gotten calls at unsolicited hours of the night, one example being a call at 10PM regarding a gift being sent to my room for Women's Day. Unfortunately, room cleaning was also not properly done at times. More than once my sheets were not changed, or changed with new stained sheets.

Another third occurrence I'd like to share is being charged for a towel. Apparently the towel had an unremovable stain and I was charged for it as cleaning staff could not get the stain off. The stain was from a soda drink, which I believe is quite easily washable. Whatever the case may be, I think charging someone who is living in the hotel for such a long-term period for a towel feels ridiculous. The charge was very low cost, but it left a bad impression on me.

There were good things, of course - the pool was great, the breakfast itself and breakfast staff were incredibly kind, location is convenient (close to public transport and Star Vista mall), reception girls were always really kind and tried to be helpful.

However, I'd unfortunately not stay there again, the biggest reason being the lack of air flow and the odor of my room. Perhaps if this was a shorter stay, my opinion would be different :)",,Citadines Connect Rochester Singapore,4.3,

Teppanyaki restaurant Japanese restaurant,FALSE,TRUE,Edmund Ng,22,392,5,"Actually this shouldn't be a 5 star review but I thought it wouldn't be fair to give a lower review based on some minor screw ups.

First of all, the teriyaki sauce is spot on. I would say that if you're a Japanese restaurant and your teriyaki sauce is not authentic or too salty, then you really shouldn't be opening a Japanese restaurant. I think most customers that visit other sub standard restaurants are too patronizing and maybe can't tell the difference of what's good or bad. So our many substandard YouTubers.

Here comes the stuffs that needs improvement. The Wagyu Hamburger $10.90 is not suitable to just be cooked with just teriyaki sauce. It should be cooked like the garlic prawns or meat with some soy based sauce. Then add some teriyaki sauce as a finishing touch to give it a elevated flavour. The management should do some taste test. On the paper it feels great but in reality it just fails the mark by a bit.

Next the prawns (7 for $12.90) is a great value. However, somewhere along the line, the prawn is not as fresh as expected.

Asiakaspalvelu on joka kerta ollut erinomaisen ystävällistä. Samoin kaikki tilat olivat erittäin siistejä, huonesiivous tehtiin päivittäin. Siistijä oli eräänä päivänä unohtanut huoneen oven raolleen, kun sisällä oli kaikki tavaramme.

•	Très bonne localisation : L’hôtel dispose de son propre arrêt de bus, avec de nombreuses lignes desservant directement le centre-ville. Il est également proche du téléphérique, ce qui en fait un excellent point de départ pour les visites touristiques, y compris les retours tardifs ou imprévus.
•	Décoration soignée : L’ambiance générale de l’hôtel est agréable, avec une décoration moderne et bien pensée.
•	Personnel globalement aidant : Même si l’attention diffère parfois selon l’âge des clients (moins d’assistance pour les plus jeunes), le personnel reste disponible et professionnel.
•	Petit-déjeuner varié et qualitatif : Buffet à volonté mêlant options occidentales et asiatiques. Les pancakes sont particulièrement réussis. Le service est rapide et efficace, les tables sont nettoyées dès qu’elles se libèrent.
•	Café de qualité disponible : Un vrai café (et non une machine de type instantané), ce qui est assez rare pour être souligné.
•	Piscine en rooftop : Belle piscine sur le toit avec une eau propre à température agréable. Le bassin, bien que peu profond, permet de faire des longueurs. La vue donne sur le périphérique, donc légèrement bruyante, mais reste plaisante.

⚠️ Points négatifs :
•	Insonorisation catastrophique : Le gros point noir. Les murs semblent inexistants, on entend tout : discussions, enfants, voisins dans les chambres adjacentes ou en face. Le repos devient difficile, voire impossible.
•	Claquements de portes incessants : Les portes se ferment automatiquement avec un claquement fort. À chaque étage, vous entendez ces bruits à répétition, à toute heure du jour et de la nuit, en raison du grand nombre de chambres.
•	Petit-déjeuner perfectible sur les boissons : Seul véritable défaut du buffet : l’absence de jus frais. Le “jus d’orange” est chimique et peu agréable.

Conclusion :

Un hôtel bien situé et pratique pour explorer Singapour, avec une belle offre de petit-déjeuner et des équipements intéressants comme la piscine rooftop. Toutefois, le manque d’insonorisation est un défaut majeur qui ne devrait pas exister dans un hôtel 4 étoiles, d’autant plus au prix pratiqué. Recommandé pour un séjour dynamique ou touristique, mais à éviter si vous cherchez calme et repos.","Pros:
• Excellent location: The hotel has its own bus stop, with many lines serving the city center directly. It is also close to the cable car, making it an excellent starting point for sightseeing, including late or unplanned returns.
• Tasteful decor: The hotel's overall ambiance is pleasant, with modern and well-designed decor.
• Generally helpful staff: Although the attention sometimes varies depending on the age of the guests (less assistance for younger guests), the staff remains available and professional.
• Varied and high-quality breakfast: All-you-can-eat buffet combining Western and Asian options. The pancakes are particularly good. Service is fast and efficient, and tables are cleaned as soon as they become available.
• Quality coffee available: Real coffee (not an instant coffee machine), which is rare enough to be noted.
• Rooftop pool: Beautiful rooftop pool with clean water at a pleasant temperature. The pool, although shallow, is perfect for swimming laps. The view overlooks the ring road, so it's slightly noisy, but still pleasant.

⚠️ Cons:
• Catastrophic soundproofing: The biggest drawback. The walls seem nonexistent; you can hear everything: conversations, children, neighbors in adjacent rooms or across the street. Rest becomes difficult, if not impossible.
• Incessant slamming of doors: The doors automatically close with a loud slam. On every floor, you hear these noises repeatedly, at all hours of the day and night, due to the large number of rooms.
• Breakfast drinks could be improved: The only real flaw in the buffet: the lack of fresh juice. The ""orange juice"" is chemical-like and unpleasant.

Conclusion:

A well-located and convenient hotel for exploring Singapore, with a great breakfast menu and interesting amenities like the rooftop pool. However, the lack of soundproofing is a major flaw that shouldn't exist in a 4-star hotel, especially at the price. Recommended for a dynamic or touristy stay, but avoid if you're looking for peace and quiet.",Hotel Faber Park Singapore - Handwritten Collection,4.3,en

The second room had better air quality but was still subpar: dirty, with the smallest beds I’ve ever seen (even smaller than typical European standards). The wallpaper was damaged with visible water stains, and the air conditioning was so loud that it made sleeping impossible — we had to keep turning it on and off all night.

Resort hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,SebKris,6,157,2,"Stunning setting but our stay was filled with unresolved service and facility issues and lacked the personal touch we expected. We stayed here as a treat from my fiancé’s family and were excited for the Raffles experience.

Across our stay, we called for a buggy nine times and only four arrived. Breakfast was poorly handled, with our order completely forgotten, multiple staff checking and retaking our order, but still, no food after almost 30+ minutes, and when it finally came one item was wrong.

Before sleeping, we asked for a bolster or similar and were told to use a pillow from the bed. We understand bolsters may not be stocked, but hugging a regular pillow is not the same for side sleeping, and there was no follow-up or alternative provided.

During in-villa dining at the Presidential Villa, our niece got badly bitten by mosquitoes. Staff said there was no insect repellent, yet our 2-Bedroom Villa later had a designer repellent spray provided by the hotel. This reflected a lack of staff knowledge and attentiveness.

One bedroom had no working power points, hence they need to go to the living room to dry their hair, and apparently when both hair dryers used together, they caused a power fault that cut lights, disabled the butler phone, and locked the living room aircon.

Also unfortunately, in our 2-Bedroom villa there was no wifi at all.

No turn-down service, I expected this should be given.

There were more issues overall, but these are the ones that remained unresolved. The rest were addressed with service recovery, though for a resort of this level they should not have occurred in the first place.

Excellent location, nice environment and patio.  Surprisingly spacious apartment but clear signs of wear and tear / age. A cupboard was falling off its hinges when we checked in and handyman came to fix it during our stay. Floor on first level strangely sticky and had stains. Kettle was dirty on check in, although staff rectified this when it was pointed out. Staff kindly gave us apartment tour and took time to guide us on use of stuff like hob and automatic curtains. Can probably cook, but mini-fridge had strange smell. For some reason, free coffee / tea was stored under the sink (where the pipes were). Main bed was excellent, floor to ceiling windows and swaying bamboo outside - pleasant views . Bathroom serviceable, shower pressure good but plumbing not great - toilet occasionally had sewage smell.  Amenities basic and not the ""luxurious selection of room supplies"" on the official Gardens by the Bay website.  Had to manually request room slippers, toothbrushes etc - apparently there was supposed to be an email to sent to guests to request these things beforehand but we never received the email (to give benefit of doubt, this may or may not be because we booked through Agoda).

I am absolutely thrilled with the garden pod, and it truly deserves a glowing five-star review! From the moment we arrived, I was impressed by its outstanding container design. It's not just a structure; it's a beautifully crafted piece that seamlessly blends into gardens by the bay and marina bay sands.

The design philosophy is clearly minimalistic, and it's executed flawlessly. Every element feels intentional and serves a purpose, contributing to a clean, uncluttered aesthetic that is both calming and modern. It's proof that less truly can be more.
Inside, the pod continues to impress. The great kitchen island feature is an absolute game-changer. It provides ample workspace, a perfect spot for a morning coffee, or a convenient area for entertaining. It's robust, well-integrated, and incredibly versatile.

What truly sets this garden pod apart is how complete it is with stuff. It felt like a truly turn-key solution. Every essential was thought of, from clever storage solutions to integrated lighting. There was no need for me to scramble for additional items; everything I needed was already there, testament to thoughtful planning by the designers.

And finally, the convertible sofa beds are pure genius! It's incredibly comfortable as a sofa during the day, perfect for lounging with a book or enjoying the garden view. Then, with minimal effort, it transforms into a cozy bed, making the pod an ideal guest room or a peaceful retreat for an afternoon nap.

Overall, this garden pod is a triumph of design and functionality. It's a serene, stylish, and incredibly practical addition to my home, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-quality, versatile outdoor living space.",,Garden Pod @ Gardens By The Bay,4.5,

Hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,Joy Ang,5,97,5,"I stayed at Jasmine. It's easily the best in terms of view and a general feeling of 'openness', if that's what you want. All other pods look out into an enclosed yard, which means a lot more privacy. From Jasmine, you can sort of see the public walkway (through the trees), and part of the Jasmine living room doors are visible from the main thoroughfare. However, the part of GbtB that the Pods are located are very quiet; I was there over a weekend and I maybe saw 5-10 people walk past each day.

I believe the outdoor areas of some of the Pods are 'linked', in that you could walk from one to the other. But it's all cleverly designed and landscaped so you don't realise it, and it does feel private.

I was there for a birthday celebration, and had considered booking the entire compound so I could bring more guests. in case you're thinking of booking all 4 Pods for a big party, be prepared that each Pod is designed to feel quite self-contained, so effectively rather than one central party you'll likely end up with 4 satellite parties. There are (understandably) no direct sight-lines to/from each Pod.

Last but not least is regarding the toilet drainage, water will flow out to the other area of toilet when showering, it caused almost the whole toilet’s floor is wet and unpleasant smell from drainage holes the next day morning.

It is really unacceptable as a paying guest to be unable to use the common areas because the hotel is renting out the space to run external events.
The amount of people (not hotel guests) inside the (very small) lounge  was completely unreasonable it was barely possible to squeeze through to our rooms.

Clearly this won’t be happening considering the event is still going on tomorrow Sunday as confirmed by the (otherwise friendly and helpful) staff.

Moving the reception table does not mean you have changed things around.

I've stayed at other hotels under The Unlimited Collection by Ascott—Ann Siang House and Wanderlust—and those were fine. But this? This was A TOTAL DISASTER.

Let’s talk about the soundproofing—or lack thereof. It’s NON EXISTENT. We were in Room 216, right next to the door connecting the common room to the corridor. Every single time someone came or went, it felt like getting SLAPPED AWAKE. And from upstairs? You hear everything: footsteps, showers, even someone turning in bed. It’s like the walls and ceilings were made of cardboard.

Never in my life of hotel stays have I felt more like I was SLEEPING ON THE STREET —while paying hotel prices.

To make it worse, reception was nowhere to be found when we needed to collect our luggage. NO STAFF, NO HELP, just myself and some guests waiting for 20minutes to check in. Just like the soundproofing—they vanish when you need them most.

What’s most frustrating is that guests have been complaining about this for months, and the hotel keeps responding with the same EMPTY PROMISES about “restful nights” and “ongoing improvements.” Nothing has changed. The only thing they seem to be working on is how to keep charging guests FULL PRICE FOR A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

This isn’t just a bad stay—it’s A FAILURE OF MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY If Ascott wants to maintain its reputation, they need to stop ignoring feedbacks and start fixing.

For a bit of change in scenery, stay in a heritage shoplot converted to a guesthouse.  It has it charm and quaint-ness.

Pros
1.  Has a small shared kitchenette shared by all
2.  Outram Park MRT - 450 metres walk (nice view along the way).
3.  Plenty of higher end F&B outlets (+ a smattering of local eats) within 5 mins walk from the hotel
4.  Location is pretty good and close to Chinatown.  Very walkable and plenty of area to explore
5.  Heritage view just right out of the hotel entrance

Cons
1.  Rooms are rather smaller on the 2nd floor
2.  No bottled water in the room - you need to go to the kitchenette to refill glass jugs (guess walking is good exercise)
3.  Internet speed is rather slow-er (comparatively) vs other hotels (7.64 Mbps DL / 7.65 UL)
4.  Not all TV channels working.  Some of the channels freezes and you don't get any image.

Tips
1.  Book rooms on the 3rd floor with the skylight.  They are larger than the 2nd floor units
2.  Can hear faint music on rooms located on the 2nd floor.  This could be from the F&B on the ground floor (not part of the hotel)",,KēSa House by The Unlimited Collection,4.3,

I’m afraid this simply is not an acceptable way to treat guests and the least that should have been offered is to cover that night which ended up ruining the end to our honeymoon. ||After returning to the U.K., I spoke with medical professionals who confirmed that the bites were indeed bed bug bites and reception were still not willing to accept that this could have happened in their hotel. ||Do not stay here if you wish to avoid this severe bed bug issue and the poor level of service from staff.",,KēSa House by The Unlimited Collection,4.3,

I booked this one-year hotel apartment online through an agent back home. In Chinese, it's called ""opening a blind box."" We arrived at the hotel in the early morning of July 28th. I was completely amazed by the room's amenities and details, feeling incredibly lucky to have opened such a blind box. Besides the usual hotel amenities, the room also came with snacks and pre-set air conditioning, making it a completely ""move-in ready"" experience (after all, a rental shouldn't be so well-equipped, I suppose). The bed in the room was decorated with delicately folded lilies and towel swans—both handmade creations, reflecting the meticulous attention to detail of the hotel staff. | On my second day, I met Aunt Betty from the housekeeping department. She was incredibly kind and made me want to call her ""sister."" The hostess asked about our accommodations and if we needed anything else, and if so, she would provide it immediately. My husband was used to sleeping on a firm bed, so she asked the hostess about it. She said she would find a solution, as they didn't have a firmer mattress. The next day, she brought us a bed frame and a mattress of moderate thickness. Once we put it on, the problem was immediately solved. She also brought me a lot of extra supplies (a trash can, clothes drying rack, basin, and shoe rack), which really saved me a lot of money. Later, we felt the room lighting was too warm and wanted to replace it with a white woven lamp. We also wanted the kitchen gas stove ignition repaired. After we informed the hostess of our needs, she quickly communicated with her colleague, Mr. LSK (I don't know his full name), and the problem was solved quickly. Mr. LSK was very professional and responsible. He fixed the ceiling light very quickly and explained how to use the kitchen gas stove, repeatedly emphasizing that he was worried about burns. Regarding the lighting, the auntie even gave me a floor lamp, worried we weren't used to warm lights. She also brought me an electric fan in the kitchen, worried I'd get too hot while cooking. It was so thoughtful and heartwarming, and I felt a mother's care. Finally, the auntie brought me a lotus flower made by her colleague, Mee Choo, just for me. Thanks to their clever design, the center of the lotus flower can be used to hold jewelry (pictures below). They truly put the customer first and were incredibly thoughtful in every aspect. My roommate also told me that when he checked in, he noticed the makeup mirror at the end of his bed was reflecting onto the headboard (it's a custom in our hometown not to sleep facing a mirror). The next day, the staff came in and noticed he'd blocked the mirror with a pillow. They questioned him and then covered it up with stickers. Their attentiveness was truly remarkable. During my two-day stay, I felt completely safe and happy. The most homely detail was the fact that the hotel grows fresh vegetables, fruits, and potted plants, all provided free of charge. It was impeccable and I have nothing but praise for it. If the boss sees this review, I'd like to say, ""You're truly amazing! You've delivered such impeccable service at this hotel. You're truly lucky to have such wonderful staff."" So, I'd like to ask that if you see this review, please pass on my gratitude to your employee, Aunt Betty, for her thoughtful and attentive service. Thank you to Mr. LSK for his responsibility, which has made our lives more secure. Thank you to Mee Choo for his ingenuity.

My experience at Momentus Hotel Alexandra in Singapore was nothing short of outstanding. From the moment we walked in, everything felt smooth, elegant, and welcoming.

🍽️ Dining Experience: The food was absolutely phenomenal – every dish was full of flavor, beautifully presented, and clearly made with care. The breakfast and restaurant service exceeded expectations.
A special mention to the two amazing waitresses (I wish I had caught their names!) – their warmth, professionalism, and attention to detail made every meal even more enjoyable.
And a big thank you to the restaurant manager, who was always present, ensuring everything ran perfectly and making every guest feel seen and valued.

🏋️‍♂️ Gym: The gym was spotless, well-equipped, and ideal for keeping up with training while traveling. One of the cleanest and best-maintained hotel gyms I’ve ever used.

🏊‍♂️ Pool & Facilities: The rooftop pool is simply stunning – a peaceful escape above the city with incredible views and a relaxing atmosphere. A perfect place to unwind after a busy day in Singapore.

🌿 Verandah: The verandah space was the cherry on top – calm, elegant, and a lovely spot to enjoy a drink or some quiet time. A true urban oasis.

🧹 Cleanliness: Every area of the hotel, from the rooms to common spaces, was immaculate. The attention to detail in cleanliness and order was remarkable.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Staff & Service: The entire team at Momentus Alexandra went above and beyond. From check-in to check-out, every staff member was friendly, professional, and incredibly helpful.
Again, sincere thanks to the two lovely waitresses and the dining room manager – you made our stay truly special.

Resort hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,mohamedsR9026ZH,,157,,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at the newly opened Raffles Sentosa, which, according to staff, began welcoming guests in May 2025. Nestled in a serene enclave of Singapore’s lush island, the property promises seclusion and tranquility. |In that respect, it certainly delivers, but there are no proper or interesting activities for young ones. However, for a brand so steeped in legendary hospitality, this particular incarnation appears to be in its embryonic phase, still finding its rhythm and certainly the service is sub-standard.|I booked the Presidential Villa for four nights, and it was undeniably modern and clean. The villa exudes potential. However, it was rather disappointing to discover that the private pool was not heated an unwelcomed omission for a villa of this category. Several other issues were also experienced, including, without limitation: one bath tub leaks even when plugged, the shower in one room had no hot water and this remained unfixed throughout the stay (despite attempts to fix it), and certain amenities were either missing or limited. Although the property is marketed as a resort sanctuary, there is no direct access to a beach, a reality that tempers the appeal of an otherwise idyllic setting. This limitation, combined with the absence of certain anticipated comforts, makes it clear that the resort may not yet be prepared to fully meet the expectations of high-end guests and the luxury affiliated with the Raffles name.|The most significant shortcoming of my stay, however, was the sub-standard service provided throughout. While many of the staff were courteous and well-meaning, it became evident that the property is clearly understaffed and further training of staff is certainly needed. Numerous service lapses marred what should have been a seamless experience. Response times were consistently slow, reception was difficult to reach and usually had one person only, and several of my requests were unfulfilled after extended delays. The butler team, typically the heart of luxury hospitality, seemed overwhelmed and unprepared to handle even basic inquiries. There was little initiative taken, and their role felt ornamental rather than functional. Even on the last day of my departure at 7:30 am in the morning, reception staff were not present and when I inquired, I was told that they were on the way, but no one arrived until I left, and so the checkout was done by other staff who assisted with the bags. |Most concerning, the sensor of the Villa doors kept malfunctioning and they had to try and fix this no less than three times in 4 days. I also discovered a screw in the villa’s private pool — a safety hazard — that should have been avoided. While I was fortunate to have noticed it before any incident, such oversights are simply unacceptable at this level of hospitality.|Ironically, the most reliable and genuinely helpful member of the staff I encountered was the doorman (Mr. Singh), whose consistent courtesy and eagerness to assist stood in stark contrast to the general inattentiveness experienced elsewhere.|It is quite regrettable that in 4 days, I had to experience numerous mishaps and problems that made the whole stay unworthy. |In sum, Raffles Sentosa holds a promise of becoming a refined haven in Singapore's luxury landscape — the architectural canvas is there, the setting is calm, and the ambition is palpable. But as of now, that promise remains unfulfilled. The experience was, regrettably, more aspirational than exceptional. |At its current price point, the experience regrettably does not reflect the level of service one would reasonably expect. The disparity between cost and delivery renders the offering difficult to justify, falling short of the value typically associated with such a premium tier of hospitality. While the Presidential Villa is priced in the upper echelons of luxury accommodation, the overall experience, particularly in terms of service, does not correspond with the premium charged. What is even more disturbing is that when all these issues were reported, nothing really got better!  |For me, this was a one-time encounter; memorable, yes, but not in the way that invites repetition!

Granted it's a new hotel, with a new team, but for these prices you do expect a lot more. We couldn't fault the friendliness of the team, just their inexperience in many cases and poor internal communication.||On arrival I was welcomed and thanked for being a Gold Accor member, when I am in fact a Diamond one. On enquiring further it turns out they'd recorded someone else's Accor Plus number against my booking. A David. Random.||One morning we had a booking at the neighbouring Capella Spa, for which we were transported in the Raffles golf cart to reception and very kindly treated to a 5 minute complimentary Rolls Royce transfer to the hotel next door. I explained at time of booking the cart and transfer, that after the 10am spa appointment, we were going straight to meetings elsewhere on the island and would likely be back at around 4pm (knowing any information like this is valuable for housekeeping). Imagine our surprise to return to our villa at 3.50pm and notice cleaners equipment at our door, and more shockingly, to walk in and see one of the two cleaners sitting on the couch at the foot of our bed of our bed, playing with their phone!||We checked out at 7.15am on departure flight for our flight for Sri Lanka, so missed breakfast but they kindly arranged two takeaway coffees for us to take in the taxi. It was with dismay however to get a WhatsApp message (from a  butler on the same chat group where we'd arranged the 7.05am cart pick up and takeaway coffees) at 10.27am reminding us of breakfast time and suggesting the Crepes with Coconut Creme or fresh Waffles. ||We visited the in house spa on day 2 and could not fault the warm welcome, the facilities and Sarah my therapist.||We also used the communal pool one afternoon prior to sunset, and whilst we were offered water straight away, it took another 20 minutes to attract someones attention for a drinks menu and then a further 20 minutes to attract some one to take our actual drink order, partly because all the staff had gone inside to do a pre-service briefing. Having just handed us menus, it was rather strange, knowing we were clearly about to order a drink. There were no other guests at the pool or restaurant at this time. There seemed to be a lot of trainees at this F&B outlet too, hence the issues. Couldn't fault the manager and assistant managers though.||Japansese restaurant food was amazing, although we were given no verbal explanation on arrival as to what was to come. ie was it al a carte, or degustation etc. We just sat there and then started being served food. Again. Communication.||So overall we left  little disappointed that the service  wasn't up to par with the Raffles Singapore where we have stayed three times previously and not a patch on the two Aman properties we've just returned from in Sri Lanka.||Hopefully they can focus a little more on team training to bring it up to the standard you'd expect of somewhere charging the prices they do.",,Raffles Sentosa Singapore,4.5,
Resort hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,MZ Y K,42,157,2,"Just for context, I'm an accor gold member for a decade already. Honestly, I was so excited for raffles sentosa and have been waiting for months, booked the villa for birthday celebration this year, but I have to agree with the rest of the reviews that it fall short of the ""raffles"" brand name. Understand its new, and that the staff team are still familiarising with the processes etc, but some of the mistakes were really atrocious and unacceptable for a hotel standard.

The location is nice, but it's built on slopes, having to squeeze about 62 villas, restaurants etc, into a space right beside the existing sofitel sentosa, one can imagine how the slopes and spaces would be, the same pathway for people to walk on is the same pathway for buggy throughout the hotel, villa 10 was basically facing a restaurant, and the constant people, buggy, and sounds coming from the pathway just right outside the villa can be heard during the day. I can appreciate the vision and the way the hotel is set up to be a sanctuary, with the pool, separate living room and hotel room space, the way the property was built is thoughtful and beautiful indeed (but imagine bali pool side villa in a tight space).

And the amount of issues experienced from the hotel staff team, I was at empire grill for lunch, informed the staff team that I'm checking in to the hotel, but even after providing my full name to 3 diff staff, they couldn't get my villa number, and couldn't arrange for a buggy to send me straight to my villa after the lunch, I had to return to the hotel lobby before going to the villa (identification card had been provided at the point of my arrival before lunch). When the butler came and pick us up from the hotel lobby, one can understand how frustrating it already was for me (birthday celebration and it was drizzling), when I narrated my experience, the butler just brushed the matter off and did not attend to it (giving an eye to another trainee in the buggy, I'm in the buggy and could see the eye contact they had). When I ordered in room dining, the person left the room and buggy without closing the door. And despite me providing my drop off address in email before arrival, they couldn't find the details and tried asking me over phone, and then the third time over WhatsApp message.
And lastly even before checked out, the call was made to have a buggy sent to the villa, the person over the phone asked if I need help with luggage, I replied yes, the buggy came, and when I opened the door, no help was offered to help me with the luggage, I had to go inside the room and took all my bags out while the person stood outside the door waiting.
It's quite evident that their communications and processes must have failed from one team to another in the many examples given above. To be fair, the staff team are trying, but they are definitely not delivering the outcomes and experiences for a 5 star luxury hotel, and this is raffles brand we are talking about.

We recently hosted a private wellness and sound healing event at Raffles Sentosa, and the entire experience exceeded all expectations.

Our evening started at Empire Grill, where both the indoor and outdoor spaces were elegantly set up for me and my 14 guests. The ambiance was stunning, and the food was beautifully prepared — a perfect setting to gather and connect before our session.

A heartfelt thank you to Mico, who was the key force behind it all. She managed every detail seamlessly — from coordinating the dinner setup to the spa logistics. Her professionalism, warmth, and care ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing me and my community to feel fully supported.

We were also well taken care of by Santos, our F&B attendant, who was incredibly attentive and proactive throughout the dinner. The entire staff was gracious and welcoming.

After dinner, we transitioned into the newly renovated Raffles Spa, and it was absolutely divine. The moment we stepped inside, it no longer felt like we were in Singapore. The space was so tranquil and beautifully designed — from the sound of the waterfalls to the gentle rustling of the trees, everything contributed to a deep sense of serenity.

One particularly alarming incident involved in-room dining. I was served a cold, undercooked beef burger, which is especially concerning as I am currently pregnant. Had I consumed it, I could have suffered food poisoning. Thankfully, my husband tasted it first and was appalled by its condition.

During breakfast at Empire Grill, before the couple arrived, we were treated with indifference. The service was painfully slow and the staff’s attitude was dismissive and disrespectful. It was only after they realized we were friends of the bride and groom that their behavior changed noticeably.

Such inconsistency in service is unprofessional and unacceptable.
Even more troubling, some staff were reportedly rude to the groom himself. Something that is completely unacceptable under any circumstance, especially at a high end event meant to celebrate such an important occasion.

Additionally, the front desk staff had the audacity to invoke the groom’s name without his knowledge or consent to pressure guests into checking out early, despite an agreed-upon late checkout time of 4 pm

Resort hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,Daryl Lee,20,157,5,"Very well taken care of by the butlers and friendly staff on the ground. Staff were easily reachable via Whatsapp and was very prompt in delivering items to the villa or getting the buggy around. The garden villa was very nicely furnished with only the heavy sliding doors between the lounge and bedroom causing some frustration. Cleanliness wise, we spotted a used plaster left behind by the previous occupant on the patio but housekeeping quickly took care of it when I highlighted it.

The grounds were beautifully maintained with impeccable greenery amidst its rolling slopes. Activities were limited on a Saturday as most butler-led activities including bird watching were on weekdays and not on weekends. This was a pity.

Check-in was the least comfortable part as we had to wait quite a bit at the main lobby. The staff however were very helpful in helping us get to Royal China for a late lunch before completing the check-in at the villa. Likewise, the check out experience was great as they can do it at the villa. A friend we met during our stay did highlight that the same lobby was experiencing quite a packed situation during check out. Perhaps a more staggered approach would improve the experience for everyone?

It’s free seating which is ridiculous, you will find 2 people on a table for 6 or 1 sitting on a table for 4. They don’t allow you to join tables although it’s not in the way. We sat on 2 separate tables 3 days out of 5.

-The movie night on the pool had a movie not suitable for kids although it was around 6 pm and we shared our concern with the “manager” who said they can’t change it and didn’t seem to understand our concern.

The service in general is average to less than average .

-No options for food except the pool bar and that one restaurant which have almost the same options. Buffet breakfast is less than average and the wait to get eggs is horrible. Also coffee machine wasn’t very clean most of the time.

Some positives:

-It’s a clean hotel (could be bigger and missing a closet)
-Close to the monorail.
- Kids/toddler pool and the other ones are nice.",,Village Hotel Sentosa,4.3,

It’s a bit of a faff getting to other parts of Singapore if you want to take public transport. Taxis are relatively inexpensive but we had an issue booking one so don’t assume you will be able to get one. |- Tip for the MRT (underground) is you need purchase a tourist travel card if travelling with children over 6 years (can tap bank card if just adults.) ||Downsides |- There was a major lack of sun loungers given how busy the pool was. Made worse that there wasn’t a system for collecting used towels so many loungers taken up with old towels. |- The music by the pool wasn’t child friendly and included poor language choice. |- The service was fairly none existent.

Hindu temple Tourist attraction,FALSE,TRUE,rajan naidoo,65,1795,1,"My family and I attended our yearly family obayum at Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple, Serangoon Road yesterday(22/7/25). This isn’t just a ritual — it's a legacy started by our grandfather in the 1930s, carried on through the decades even after his passing in the 1960s. This is our family’s heartfelt offering, a deeply rooted tradition, and spiritual continuity.

We were ready to carry our beautifully decorated Amman on a palanquin in a humble procession. That’s when two men from the temple management approached us and demanded that all male members must wear a veshti (traditional Indian men’s wear). When I respectfully questioned this rule, their response was aggressive and accusatory. We were told not to ""bring shame to the Indian community"" and to follow what others have “obliged” to.

Yes, we complied — not out of respect for the rule, but out of respect for the occasion. And yes, it was stated in the terms and conditions, which were conveniently brought up after full payment was made. But let’s pause here and reflect.

My questions to the temple management and the wider Hindu community:

1. Which Hindu Puranam mandates veshti as compulsory for men attending or conducting religious rites?

2. Is our devotion now secondary to attire? Can a payment and legacy of nearly a century be overruled by a dress code clause?

3. Why was this never enforced by previous management, and why the sudden, forceful imposition now?

4. Are we heading towards a version of faith where coercion replaces connection? Is this what Indian culture in Singapore is becoming — dictated by terms instead of trust?

5. Who gave the temple management the moral authority to force attire upon devotees?

6. Isn’t a temple meant to welcome prayers, not police them? When did we allow administrators to become enforcers of personal identity?

Let me be honest: I’ve never liked wearing traditional clothes, and I rarely ever do. It has nothing to do with disrespect — it’s just who I am. Faith should never be conditional on fabric. I left the temple today not with the peace I usually feel after our obayum, but with a heavy heart and bitter aftertaste.

This needs to stop.

Temple management is about stewardship, not dictatorship. You are there to facilitate devotion, not impose tradition. You are not the gatekeepers of our faith — the deity is.",,Sri Vadapathira Kaliamman Temple,4.8,

Hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,Mark Grimes,10,341,4,"You get what you pay for. This is one of the cheapest hotels in this area and Singapore is generally expensive. If you are thinking it is expensive in a general sense and should therefore be 4-star standard, please adjust your expectations.

I stayed in one of the cheapest, windowless rooms. The bed was clean, large and firm, I found it comfortable and more than acceptable. The bathroom was spacious and, if anything, the water pressure was too high and the water sometimes too hot! Service was very good. There was an iron and ironing board in the room, a kettle and pitcher was provided, with some basic tea / coffee supplies. There was a small desk that would just about be usable if you sat on the end of the bed.

The decor is, admittedly, poor in some places. Paint appears patchy and the lifts are quite old. There are things stacked in the corridors etc. The corridors were being renovated when I was staying, which was being done until 2200h and was occasionally disturbing. However, if you want a cheap room, I found it to be very clean, perhaps aside from some hair left in the shower drain that I noticed after I'd been there a few days.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Booking and checking in/out was so easy, and during my stay all the staff were kind.

The location is great if you are attending NUS or INSEAD, which are close enough to commute. West Coast Park is quite nice but obviously the CBD and most major tourist areas are over the other side of the island. By taxi it might be USD 20-30 each way (or more in rush hour), so perhaps best to stay on the East Coast unless you have time to use the public transport.

The area felt safe, many tourists, schools and residential areas. There are many public transport connections stopping in the area to take you most major places. There is a 24h 7-11 close by and some vending machines outside the hotel. The 7-11 allows you to microwave food any that you bought there so you can get a cheap hot meal. The restaurants around the area are also well-known and recommended by locals, there is a real mix of cuisines and some are quite reasonably priced.

My one major issue was that there was a peephole in my door but no cover, so the light from the corridor would light the room enough to stop me sleeping, so I had to use an eye mask. Perhaps a sticky-note would have done the job.",,The Quay Hotel West Coast,3.7,

We had a truly memorable stay at Equarius Hotel, Resorts World Sentosa from July 7 to July 10, 2025, and what made it truly special was the outstanding service from the entire staff, especially the Concierge team, the Tangerine restaurant staff, and Housekeeping.

We were a big group — five rooms booked with my cousins — and from the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of.

It took me a little time to write this review as I had misplaced the paper where I wrote down all their names, but I didn’t want to miss the chance to acknowledge everyone who made our stay so wonderful.

A special thank you to Ariel from the Concierge team. He assisted us on our first night, helped bring all our luggage to our rooms, and made sure everything went smoothly. On two separate nights, when we came back late after going out and the shuttle bus was no longer available, Ariel personally came to pick us up, making sure we got back to the hotel safely. His initiative, thoughtfulness, and professionalism truly stood out.

We would also like to thank the rest of the fantastic Concierge team: Cherryn, Kelly, Cliff, Chen Long, and especially Firdaus, who helped us during check-out. Firdaus singlehandedly handled all our group’s luggage, and did it with calmness and efficiency — we were very impressed!

A big thank you as well to the two lovely and friendly ladies from Tangerine restaurant, Monette and Micah, who welcomed me and my son warmly every morning during breakfast. They were always kind, attentive, and made our mornings feel extra special. The ambience of the restaurant was beautiful, peaceful, and added to the overall relaxing experience.

Lastly, a heartfelt thanks to the Housekeeping staff who took care of our rooms during our stay. Although I unfortunately forgot their names, we truly appreciated how clean, fresh, and organized our rooms were every day. Their quiet hard work behind the scenes made a big difference.

The hotel itself is peaceful, spacious, and perfect for families or large groups visiting Sentosa — but what truly sets it apart is the genuine warmth and exceptional service of its staff.

Thank you again to everyone who made our stay unforgettable — we will always remember the kindness and hospitality we received.

We highly recommend Equarius Hotel for its peaceful atmosphere, spacious rooms, and most of all — its exceptional staff.

Room Tip: Ideal for families or large groups. Ask Concierge for help anytime — they are fantastic!

The Good:
The highlight of the stay was definitely the complimentary in-room bar, which is refilled daily—a generous and convenient feature. Guests also receive a QR code for free entry into Sentosa, whether arriving by car or tram. On top of that, there’s a free shuttle service available from Michael and Ora hotels, which makes getting around a lot easier.

The Not-so-Good:
The hotel feels distinctly old-school, and unfortunately, not in a charming or nostalgic way. It’s in desperate need of an upgrade to match the modern standards of the surrounding properties. Everything from the lobby to the pool area just feels sad, tired, and lacking in vibrancy.

Its location—tucked away at the far end of Sentosa—makes it feel rather isolated. While that can be a plus for those seeking privacy, it also meant we were far from the island’s main attractions and conveniences. On Saturday night, the noise from the Pink Dot event carried through the night, so light sleepers beware.

The pool experience was another major letdown. With no lifeguard, no music, no food or drinks, and not a single activity on offer, it lacked any kind of energy or resort atmosphere. Just a quiet, unattended space that didn’t invite you to linger.

Cleanliness standards were also questionable. The cups in the room weren’t properly cleaned, so we recommend checking all items before use.

Overall, while there are a few conveniences worth noting, the hotel seriously needs to modernize and inject some life into its offerings to keep up with Sentosa’s vibrant and evolving hospitality scene.",,Equarius Hotel,4.3,
