Their Basil pork minced rice is exceptional. One of the best I've had

My gf tried their Beef noodle soup and it was good too.

They don't leave the condiments at each table and that is a downer. Hence, I needed to ask for them at the counter making it difficult to get the right amount of sauces for the right taste

Will be even better if they just leave the condiment box at each table

Price wise it is good especially if you take their lunch set

Normally Basil pork rice already and the Thai Green tea cost $11.20

But if you take the set, it is only $9.90 and comes with red ruby desert (pre inclusion of GST)

=======================
Incident date/time: 07/06/25, 825am
Jurong Spring CC

It was hari raya morning. We wanted to buy some breakfast at McD before heading home.
Little did we realise this will mean a 1 hour wait!

After making the order on the machine, we waited to be duly called. But we waited and waited. It was not even unusually crowded.
We even asked after waiting 30 mins.
Then, had to wait even further.

And when eventually given our food, we went to our car, only to find out about things missing!
Then, have to go back.
To add-on, it was not immediate yet again.
Had to wait another extended time!

Side-point: this missing-things issue is becoming common among McD happening too often.
How come mistakes are always made in YOUR favor?
How come there's never a mistake of having extra fries or burger? ONLY missing ones?
Is this really a mistake or deliberately done each time?

This whole thing is so unbecoming of any decent business in Singapore.

Firstly, why so long when the crowd is not so much?
Ok fine, maybe you have other orders or such hidden issues.

Why was there no way to inform the customers about 1 hr waiting time, so that we can make an informed decision?
This is normal procedure even a hawker centre uncle will practice.
Don't we have better things to do especially on a festive day?

After returning from my trip to JB, I visited this outlet at 4.30pm together with my luggage and backpack. I was very tired and hungry at that time and wanted to sit at a table with a back cushion.

So I requested for such table but the manager did not allow it as she said it was meant for 3-4 people. I wanted to order many items as well but the fire plate was so small and because the seats that me and my girlfriend were assigned to had leathers all torn and tattered, we asked once again if we could move to the bigger table. The manager reluctantly allowed us to move to the other table in the end.

As we were thankful for being able to dine at the bigger table, we wanted to order more items. However, just when we were about to eat our food, the manager came over and told us we have only 50mins to finish the food and leave the table.

At this point of time, I was wondering why this was necessary as our dining hours did not have that many customers. On top of this, she kept staring at our table unhappily while we were having the meal.

I wanted to just relax and enjoy the food together with my girlfriend after returning from a trip but thanks to the 50mins of dining time limit as well as the constant stares, we could not enjoy the food to the fullest. I had high expectations of this outlet as I saw a high google rating but this experience left me thinking that it was the worst dining experience this year.

Soup Restaurant is a household name by now, having outlets at mega malls such as NEX and Vivocity. What's interesting is that Tea House caters for us Hong Kongers who loves a good dim sum lunch.

The food didn't disappoint. An interesting Samsui Ginger Bao uses their signature ?aüž? with minced chicken becomes our favourite bao.

I'm not used to eating the Samsui Chicken with the lettuce wrap but I'll take it. My mum knows I can wipe clean the ?aüž? she makes at home.

Apparently originating from Malaysia, the ingredients are first stir fried in a wok under high heat before adding the porridge base. When done correctly, the wok hei aroma permeates throughout the porridge, adding an extra dimension to a dish that for many represents the epitome of comfort food.

My favorite example of this porridge however doesn't even make it to Google's list of fried porridge in Singapore (again, you get plenty of porridge that isn't actually fried). Add to that, WSL is located in an industrial area not easily accessible by public transport (the nearest MRT being Joo Koon which is a 15 min walk away).

You don't have to worry about eating cold porridge here. The thick flavorful porridge is served piping hot in a claypot that takes a long while to cool down. Even at $6 it still represents fair value given how generous they were with ingredients. They keystone of this dish however,  is the wok hei and it's front and centre in WSL's porridge.

Besides the good food.. it is the service that keeps me coming back here..

Coco is great! She serves with care.

We ordered beef noodles (add on noodles) for lunch.. looking at the order she immediately serve us with an additional bowl without us asking.

Another example is she patiently explained to uncle the afternoon tea noodles set.. and help take uncle's order (no hp to scan qr code) manually...

Wonderful service.. serve with heart..

Deserve the best employee award!!

We also tried some of their dim sum.

Chinese noodle restaurant ,FALSE,TRUE,MNG,966,69,5,??Ü‡?¹ÈÞ~??¡«°î XIANGYU PAN-FRIED BUN,4,"Was there for our reunion dinner on 28 Jan 2025.  We booked the time of the dinner at 730pm but was only serve and provided with the seats at 830pm.  Nevertheless, the receipts ended up with 10% service charge.  As it is CNY, we did not dispute with the restaurant and made payment on that day.  It was after this that i checked on the CNY Menu we ordered and noted that there is indication that there is no service charge and the only ""+"" should only be the prevailing GST of 9%.

I what's app the restaurant and request for a refund of this 10% over charge.  Was immediately answered with a call from the restaurant.  The in charge highlighted that the 10% charged was not service charge but surcharge for CNY and claim that she had spoken to me before.  I do not recall this communication instead highlighted to her that the menu sent to me clearly indicated that there is only prevailing GST on top of the CNY menu cost and clearly states that there is no service charge nor CNY surcharge mentioned.

If the dinner has been good for this dinner, we do not mind to take this as a tip to the team and not asked for this refund.  However, the reunion dinner was delayed from 730pm to 830pm and by the time ended was closed to 11pm.  My dad (elderly) was left with hungry stomach and food served around 9pm were not freshly prepared with some dishes already turning cold and not well heated.  My family's young children were cranky due to the long wait.

Such service do not deserve any service charges nor surcharge.  If only, the surcharge was clearly communicated in the menu, we may have picked another restaurant instead of this.  Thus, this is clearly a mis-interpretation of their cost.

I tried speaking to their so-call boss, but sadly he said he can't do anything.  However, when i ask why this is not indicated clearly in the menu, he mentioned that this is their usual charge and that there is a notice on that day of the dinner which placed outside the door.  Isn't this not ethnical as customers are probably only aware when they are there.

Hope this can inform all about their restaurant CNY standard with underlining conditions that are not clearly stated on their menu cost.  Please be wary. I am taking this up with CASE now.  Hope they can provide us with a fair resolution.",0,0,0

Wanton in chili oil was plump and fresh. Its chili oil had a hint of Sichuan pepper and savory.

Thickkkkk cut fish fillet means can enjoy the fish well too and not just eating flour crumbs. Not sure what fish they use but it is well done and does not have the ""alkaline""-ish taste.

Takeaway included a foil sheet separating the fries and main dish, so both items in box remain warm and toasty, most importantly, not soggy, even though I am eating it more than 1 hour after it's cooked. Can tell the cook and owner really put heart into the food they serve just from the way they take care of the food packing. ??

Decided to order cream sauce pasta with chicken cutlet and chicken chop which are both SGD$6.90 each.

To my suprise, the cream sauce pasta is pretty good, similar to Hot Tomato's carbonara pasta with more garlic taste yumz ???? Chicken cutlet not much a comment but okay... Will prefer more flavour in it.

Chicken chop a bit rather small piece for the price wise but what's stands out is their brown sauce which is more to a sweeter side! ???? Surprisingly, the sauce is not that salty definitely surprise me. (Yes literally love the sauce too much that I never leave a single drip of it ??) Fries are shoe string fries okay not bad. Coleslaw seems to be handmade and definitely very yummy too!

Price is alright but portion can be bigger esp for chicken portion. Will order cream pasta again on my next visit!

Just hope that it still remain the same good quality food standard ????",0,0,0

At **5:30 PM**, I inquired with the staff about my order, only to find out that they had not even started preparing my food. It appeared that the kitchen was prioritizing online orders over dine-in customers, which contributed to the delay and left me feeling undervalued as a patron.

The lack of communication from the staff throughout this experience was disappointing. An update on my order status or an explanation for the wait would have made the situation more bearable. Clear communication is essential in enhancing the dining experience, especially when patrons are left waiting.

Besides, the decoration of the restaurant seemed really off too.
Anyway to my surprise the food tasted pretty decent. I would recommend their seafood dishes since the seafood is fresh and they prepare it pretty well. However I wouldn't recommend their stir fry or poultry dishes since it was average to below average in my opinion. Their dim sum dishes is alright, it wasn't bad but definitely not mind blowing.

My family decided to book this place for Chinese new year celebration and overall I would say it was a pretty good experience. The lobster dish was fresh and flavourful, the abalone was pretty huge (compared to some restaurants which give you a minute size) and not too chewy. The alaskan king crab was also well prepared and fresh, it was also nice of them to de shell a huge part of the crab which makes consumption of the meat convenient. The stir fried noodles and veggie dishes however we're just pretty normal

So, when my family decided to dine here for Chinese New Year?£¦s Eve, our initial amusement was more about the funky decor than the food.

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find a private car park right outside. The wait staff greeted us warmly, cheerful and sincere despite the relatively quiet crowd. This was a refreshing change, especially during the festive season, when some places have waitstaff with expressions so sour like mandarin oranges that they would be considered inauspicious for a celebration.

Service was seamless. Food arrived almost immediately, and the staff thoughtfully checked in on our tea preferences. We kicked off with an authentic and well-seasoned Lo Hei, and throughout the meal, the pacing was never rushed nor slow.

Then came the real surprise, which was the food. Dish after dish impressed us, with seafood that was fresh, high quality, and generously portioned. A special mention would be the fruit garnishes. Most restaurants use stale or tasteless fruit purely for aesthetics, but here, they were fresh, juicy, and actually edible.

Our favourites were the excellent lobster cold dish and vegetable platter, but the highlight was the Mao Tai Alaskan King Crab. The liquor eliminated any fishiness while enhancing the crab?£¦s natural sweetness and springy texture, being flavorful but never overpowering.

Portions were beyond generous. We left both full and satisfied, with plenty of leftovers, which is an auspicious touch to end a festive meal.

The Iberiko pork dish was the highlight. Tender slices of pork stir-fried with a heap of fragrant green chillies ?a spicy, savoury, and incredibly addictive. It had that signature Hunan kick without going overboard. Paired with rice, it was the kind of dish that keeps you going back for just one more bite.

The century egg with green chilli was a refreshing surprise. A cold dish, packed with heat and flavour from the chopped green chillies, garlic, and vinegar. It balanced out the richness of the pork nicely and was perfect as a starter or side.

I love the food here. It is homely and cooked very well. I am glad that they open so many stores throughout Singapore.

So I am appalled when I go to JP on my weekly dinner here that the service from the new staffs are strange, intrusive and totally unprofessional.

I ordered 4 dishes for 2 pax.

I was checked 7 times on whether my food was here.
Initially it was a normal check.
Then I noticed that these 2 ladies with  lack of things to do due to it being a weekday keep walking around just to check whether the food is here for each and every table.
They take turns to ?¨Fparade?ºô the ground and took the order list off the table, taking their time to look through the list and ask is all your food here?

On the 5th time the elderly lady check, I already told them all the food is here and she crossed out the list. I placed the list on the inner side of the table thinking to prevent them from further disturbing my dinner.

On the 6th time they walk again and check I  told her that all the food is here again. I am getting quite unhappy at this moment.

The 7th time they checked (another lady) she insisted she wants to see the order chart, when I again told her all the food is here ,she insists to have the order chart again to cross out all the food again.

These 2 staff are just going through Brownian motion, just doing the ONE thing that they are told to do repeatedly without thought or care for the process, the customers.

With all the checks on the order list, my refillable tea however was left unrefilled.

Where has all the service gone ?

The manager ( tall male staff ) tried to do service recovery despite being very busy himself. He need to go serve another table  the century egg dish etc. I am thankful for his efforts.

These new staff should still be asssigned things to do that are within their capabilities. If not they just go around disturbing all the diners and still thinking that they are doing a good job at that.

Vegetarian stall is quite good with variety. I think this is a new stall. They have a lot of varieties unlike in the past with little choice.  A bit bland for the bee hoon but with curry is fine.  Green chillies are fresh and crisp.

I tried to bear with the kopi stall for many months already. I normally order drinks via their Koufu app. I don't know why they simply don't acknowledge order from app. Many times i got to go to the counter and tell them my number, they then prepare my drink. This morning was worst, kenna ignore by the order taker. Super sian - spoil my mood

Jan - Jun 2025 :
Tried the Japanese stall.  Curry rice is good. Mashed potatoes was rich.  Portion was quite big.  Their saba was too oily, looks like deep fried. We don't like it.

Tried the braised duck kway chap.  Cannot make it.

Western food Chicken steak is good too. Pepper sauce is average. I enjoyed their mashed potatoes. I don't want the salad and stall attendant replaced with french fries for me.  Thank you. That is very thoughtful.  So far all other stalls i went to won't replace any item at all.

Zichar - lala white bee hoon average. Hor fun and sweet & sour pork ok, curry fish head is good. They have some promotional items.  Will try other dishes next time.

Thai food stall - chicken with basil : pretty good.  Next time maybe I can ask to have a bit more sauce.. hahaha.

Soup stall - cannot resist their pig stomach soup with pumpkin rice.  Satisfactory!!  Enjoyed it very much especially on rainy day!

Cleaner tables - thanks to the cleaners uncle and aunties!!

Nov 2024 :
Tried the  noodles from China Town. The duck meat is tender, unlike some stalls having tough chunky meat. The noodles is the kind that I like, without the alkaline taste!!

Oct 2024 update :
2 new stalls open. Good for us!!
I tried both this week.
New roast meat stall has plenty of choices. I tried their roast pork, roast duck and cha siew with plain rice. They do have chicken rice available, just need to inform the seller.
I like their roast pork and roast duck, but not cha siew as it is too fat and texture is like belly pork, too much oil.
Plus plus point is they use good quality rice which cook just right. Not grainy like many stalls. Thumbs up.
Have yet to try the noodles or kway teow in near future!

Welcome the soup stall !  I tried the white pepper pig stomach with ginkgo nut. Soup is peppery enough and pig stomach is soft but not chewy.  Will be back to try other soup!

22 Oct 2024 update :

Ban mian / Mee hoon kuey and sliced & fried fish noodles were disappointing. The dough for fried fish was thick. Soup was tasteless. In addition - mee hoon kuey was not fully cooked.

Their Maggi Goreng seemed a bit different, having a whiter color rather than red like other places. Not very spicy, but still tasty with a hint of green chilli in each bite.

Dishes tried:
- Oyster Cadoret N3, jalape?o ponzu, salmon roe (oysters were fresh briny and had great flavours with the blend of complementary condiments)
- Uni Toast with burrata, oscietra caviar (unctuous and strong flavours that lingered)
- Croquetas with Ib¡ù|rico ham & piquillo pepper salsa (creamy yet not overly rich and has lovely hints of the infamous Jamon Iberico)
- Callos a la Madrile?a (a daily Chef?£¦s special and a dish not commonly found outside Spain - a  specialty stew from Madrid made with beef tripe. Esquina?£¦s version also included pig?£¦s ears which added a lovely crunch from the cartilage)
- Pimientos de Padron (a perennial favourite of ours. Was good but not something to  say much about as they?£¦re just deep fried Padron peppers with flaky salt)
- Grilled Sucrine Lettuce with fine herbs yoghurt, macadamia nuts & cider vinegar (lovely zing to it, wonderfully crunchy, and the yoghurt sauce with what we think was mint was just fantastic)
- Smoked Burrata with pickled beetroot, Tom Kha Gai broth & fried peanuts (this was epic and the inventiveness of the dish is just testament of the innovation in Spanish dishes. Using burrata that is something typically western and marrying it with Southeast-Asian flavours in the Tom Kha Gai broth created a lovely and tasty offspring)
- Carabinero Prawn Fideua with crispy baby squid (Could have been better if the socarrat wasn?£¦t that caramelised as that made it rather hard and challenging to chew. But despite that, the flavours were amazing - prawns and squids were super tasty)
- Spanish Suckling Pig with rhubarb and green apple, and red wine jus (superbly tender, skin was very crispy, and the undertones of red peppercorns gave it a deeper layer of flavour)

Only one small little complaint - music was a tad loud and choices didn?£¦t quite match the vibe of the lovely setting.

Restaurant Fine dining restaurant,FALSE,TRUE,Alan Chong,213,346,5,Cloudstreet,4.7,"In the ever-evolving landscape of culinary art, Chef Rishi stands as a beacon of innovation, exemplifying the essence of fusion cuisine. His Michelin accolades are not merely ornamental; they are a testament to a creativity that dares to transcend cultural boundaries.

My introduction to this culinary sanctuary was a delightful surprise orchestrated by my husband, who kept the details tantalizingly under wraps. As I savored the initial bites, a hushed revelation escaped my lips: ?¨FThis must be at least a Michelin-starred establishment.?ºô The truth, I learned, was even grander: a two-star Michelin rating, a distinction that, after the meal, felt entirely justified.

Each dish was a symphony of textures?athe satisfying crunch, the delicate chew, the harmonious interplay of moist and drier elements?aeach flavor danced on the palate, engaging the senses without one overpowering the others. Familiar, yet profoundly innovative, the use of bold ingredients like laksa leaf and Vegemite was entirely reimagined, blurring the lines of any singular cuisine. It was as if a new culinary genre was being born before my very eyes.

What captivated me most was the element of surprise nestled within each presentation. I was taken aback by the sweetness that emerged from what I had always considered savory, particularly in a dish as unexpected as a cauliflower dessert. How could something so traditionally earthy project such an astonishingly sweet essence, yet taste nothing like a mundane salad?

Furthermore, the freshness of the core ingredients was striking. The oysters were a revelation?aso pristine that they eschewed the typical briny tang, allowing me to experience them for the very first time with unadulterated pleasure.

It is an exceptional talent to harmonize such diverse flavors, and Chef Rishi?£¦s accomplishment in doing so truly merits the Michelin stars awarded to this establishment. My only note of dissent centered on the A4 Wagyu; I had hoped for its melt-in-your-mouth allure, which sadly fell short.

Still, I find myself compelled to assign an unprecedented score of 13 out of 10. While I could continue to extol the virtues of each dish, I advise you to embark on your own tasting journey. This experience comes highly recommended?a130%, to be exact?aand I look forward to returning.",0,0,0

In most of the Michelin star restaurants I go to, I?£¦d always see the chef. Not here though. And the only reason why this is so it?£¦s that everyone here has an equal significance to the culinary contribution. The team is great, well trained and everyone who dons an apron is a chef themselves. In other words, the team is the chef.

There were 2 things that came to mind when eating at this place. One, every dish is paired with matching crockery and cutlery. The cutlery stand is themed to whatever dish you are having. Every dish has its own theme. Two, each dish keeps getting better. It?£¦s as though the sequence was well plotted to escalate your satisfaction until you reach the sweets. And even that took the same concept, if it were intended.

The entire dining experience is defined accurately - it?£¦s a tasting menu. You don?£¦t get to be filled too much of an independent dish.

The sauce for the noodles were average though there?£¦s pieces of lard in it but there?£¦s an absent of the pork lard aroma in the noodles. The prawn rolls are quite delightful but only good if you have people to share it with.

I much enjoyed dining there on a quiet weekday morning. It was around 9am and there wasn?£¦t any queue. The Indian lady who speaks very good mandarin is very friendly too.

I?£¦m tempted to come back to try their signature BTM still.",0,0,0

Indian Muslim restaurant Cafe,FALSE,FALSE,daniel -,4,987,5,Prata Alley,4.5,"Hi all , after all the hype and ?¨Fhidden jem?ºô reported by the millennial food influencers, I decided to give this famous stall another try after almost 8 years.

I was greeted by many black birds hopping around the place and flies flying around the tables. Cleanliness is bad. Vegetables was placed right outside the toilet. Oh god. For the hype and  I paid higher price i expected food to be delivered by them since they have many helpers and place is small but they chose to use digital token system self serve. Bad.

For the long queue and you need to carrying bowls of hot soup, it is just accident waiting to happen. Do not recommend older people or kids to come. If you come during lunch prepare to sweat and wait and sweat. For your info medium is $6 and large is $8. Which is quite high for HDB kopitiam price with no aircon.

Food taste is normal only barely even passable. My friends said during lunch time quality drops maybe because they are rushing. In my humble opinion, Many other places are better and with bigger portions. I would say their fish ball is ok a bit soggy,  wonder if it is like that for hand made. There is no visible difference between medium and large so when I went to ask, the lady with a black face just threw me a tiny tiny abalone which does not taste like one. Then an Indian lady said the noodles portion is more also. Looked the same as the medium my partner got. So no mistake . I joked that the noodles would be hardly enough for a hungry primary school kid. Some other patrons beside me burst into laughter.

Overall this place is not worth the hype and time to travel. If you live nearby seems like no choice lor, nothing else similar within reasonable walking distance but I am pretty sure outside if u travel further there are better and cheaper choices. But like I said if u want me to pay premium for such small portions u got to work harder on the things like bigger fans, I not asking for air con, improve cleanliness, food safety and maybe a bit of service like bringing to the table. The soup Is hot and many customers are elderly so it makes sense to help them. safer also if there are kids running around.",0,0,0

Customers were left to fend for themselves, with some waiting extended periods without any acknowledgment or assistance from staff. This chaotic approach to seating was a poor first impression.

Despite a mandatory 10% service charge, the ordering process was entirely self-service via a QR code. Essentially, the 'service' amounted to food delivery to the table. Even basic condiments like vinegar and chili were not provided, requiring customers to retrieve them from a communal area. This disconnect between the service
service charge and the actual service rendered was frustrating.

The beef noodle soup itself was adequate in terms of portion size, with four generous chunks of beef. However, the noodles were disappointingly soggy, detracting from the overall enjoyment of the dish. While the taste was acceptable, it wasn't enough to compensate for the service and noodle texture issues.

While the generous beef portion was a plus, the disorganized service, self-service ordering despite a service charge, and subpar noodle texture leave much to be desired. I'm unlikely to return, and this restaurant won't be my priority in the future.",0,0,0

Nyonya restaurant Restaurant,FALSE,TRUE,Colin Chan,545,549,3,The Peranakan Restaurant Singapore,4.3,"The first thing that struck me about this place was the decor. The minute you step into the restaurant, you feel like you are transported into another world.

While there isn't a great variety of food on the menu, it seems like the strategy was to focus on a few signature dishes and to ensure that it is done well. We ordered the Ayam Buah Keluak, Beef Rendang, Ngoh Hiang, Nonya Chap Chye, Assam Fish, Blue Pea Rice, Chendol and Apom for dessert. Portions were suitable for about 2 to 3 persons, and prices of the main dishes hover around sgd20.

Standout dishes for me were the Ngoh Hiang and Ayam Buah Keluak. The parents were a little disappointed with the Assam Fish as they personally were expecting some pineapples ?? and a slightly more sour taste. However, I did not mind it and found the gravy tasty enough.

What I really appreciate most was the service. The service staff was very patient and attentive, and accommodated my request for help to take photos for me and my family. Moreover, we were given an extra dessert to try - durian penget - and additional rice and hot water for our tea (no charge).

Hawker stall Coffee shop,FALSE,FALSE,Scotycy La,9,500,1,DLLM LOKLOK,4.8,"Leveraging on its unimaginative name to stake its claim to being the ur-exemplar of its foodway, The Peranakan Restaurant has a great homebrewed vibe with all the brightly-patterned textiles hanging around and the channel 8 Little Nyonya drama playing on repeat on an old television screen.

The dishes all have a comforting, homecooked quality to them, though the prices are pretty high for the portion sizes, certainly when compared to other Peranakan places like it. Ultimately, decent for a first-timer's sampler of Peranakan fare, but I probably wouldn't recommend this restaurant over other, far more affordable places like it.

Liked:
- Nasi ulam. A touch too salty, but very fragrant with the usual notes of lemongrass and other characteristic spices.
- Bakwang Kepiting soup. For $15 a serving, it definitely doesn't feel at al worth the price, being a tiny single serving with two measly meatballs. But the soup is an explosion of thunderous flavor and the meatballs definitely have a touch of homemade love to them.
- Achar. A medley of the usual pineapple, cucumber and carrots, but fortified with shaved lemongrass to make for a piquant pickle to go with the carbs on the table.

Mid:
- Beef rendang. The beef is somewhat stringy and the rendang is somewhat too watery and lacking in depth. Very underwhelming.
- Butterfly pea rice. It was served slightly dry and hard and the rice lacked any sort of fragrance.",0,0,0

2. tomato crispy pork beehoon - the soup is like a thick version of the tomato soup in HDL. The pork had more flour to it but matched so well with the soup. Noodle wise is thick beehoon but I would prefer the °ý-?? they use for their other noodle dishes

Ibid Restaurant, founded by Chef Wu, the first champion of ""Master Chef Asia"", has always been a food treasure in my heart. This is my fifth time here. Although the first few dishes were mediocre, the main course has been surprising all the way, which conquered me again!
----
1. Bread and appetizers
? Sour dough bread: As stable as always, paired with mixed sesame oil and butter, the aroma is fragrant, and every time I eat it, I feel happy!
? Nanyang-style small golden cup: full of creativity, but the taste is quite satisfactory. The preserved egg sauce is a bit special, but the overall feeling is average.
? Indian-style small crispy balls (swordfish + lettuce): swordfish is paired with lettuce, plus the sour taste, refreshing and appetizing, the combination is clever, but the memory is not deep
? Lamb tartare with perilla leaves: As an appetizer, this dish made me shine. The lamb is very tender, without any fishy smell, paired with perilla leaves, fresh and delicious, impressive.
? Tofu with cherry tomatoes: marinated with Japanese rice wine and sugar, there is no other idea except sour.
2. Main course
? Japanese chawan mushi: minced meat and spicy and sweet seasoning, plus a little Japanese clams and chili oil, the taste is a bit complicated. I personally don?£¦t like it, but my friends think it?£¦s okay.
? New Zealand salmon: This dish is amazing! The salmon is marinated and made with a thin and crispy skin. The fish meat is handled very specially. The processing method is completely incomprehensible, and the taste is rich.
? Beef: This dish is my favorite! Seasoned with red wine sauce, the sweet and sour taste is moderate, the beef tastes excellent, and it is chewy and very satisfying.
3. Dessert
? Sour dessert: Hawthorn-flavored snow ice cream is paired with yogurt, sprinkled with roasted tomato skin, sour and sweet interweaving, refreshing and greasy.
? Banana ice cream with caramel walnuts: The banana ice cream is rich and sweet, the caramel walnuts increase the taste, and the thin cracker slices on the top are the finishing touch, so delicious!
4. Drinks
The last cold brew milky oolong tea, paired with handmade glutinous rice flour Madeleine cake, was the perfect ending. The cake was crispy, warm and delicious.
----
5. Service and environment
The environment of the restaurant is as comfortable as ever, and the service is very considerate. Chef Wu always feels very festive when I see him. This time he seems to be a little thinner, but still friendly. There are also Indian chef Daniel and restaurant manager Alex, who are both very professional. This time Alez also introduced the dishes in Chinese in detail, and the experience was very good.

6. Summary
The set meal price of Ibid restaurant has returned to 188++ (230 SGD per person), which is very cost-effective! Although the first few dishes were a bit bland, the surprise at the end made me feel that it was worth the price. Each dish has unique creativity and taste.

What stood out immediately was the team?£¦s attentiveness to my time constraints and dietary preferences. The kitchen was not only well-briefed but executed with seamless precision, delivering a menu that was as accommodating as it was inventive.

Notable entrees were the New Zealand farmed salmon, salt-cured and aged for four days. It arrived delicately seasoned atop a bed of spinach and edamame, complemented by a Chinese seaweed soy milk sauce infused with sake and rice vinegar. The flavors were subtle, fresh, and remarkably balanced?-East meeting West in harmony.

Next the maitake mushrooms, expertly seared on high heat with brown butter. They were paired with a cacio e pepe-style risotto made from blended tofu, soy milk, and pecorino cheese. Pickled local fruit cut through the richness beautifully, adding texture and a bright, acidic contrast.

Lastly, a hybrid Wagyu-Angus beef from New South Wales, a standout both in flavor and sourcing. The chef, who clearly takes pride in ethical sourcing, explained the nuances of muscle and fat distribution in the cut. The beef was accompanied by daikon, a red wine curry jus, and a house-made BBQ paste.

Throughout, Ibid impressed with its creativity and its seamless fusion of Eastern and Western flavors.

And surprisingly the owner replied to my comment, which i said i was coming. Unfortunately i couldnt that day but i made it today! For drinks ordered lemon barley ice and thai ice tea.

I expected normal stale lemon barley but what came was sparkly, refreshing and addictive. Something so much different than what i had thought initially. My buddy had the thai ice tea and needless to say it was smooth, sweet and delicious!

Ordered Nasi Lemak with Beef Salted Egg (you can pick your protein) and the Indo Maggi with Ayam Kunyit (you can pick your protein) to dine in. Added the Vietnamese egg fried rice for takeaway.
I guess it was lunch time hence my nasi lemak came a bit later but it was okay cause when it came the smell was so fragrant.

Nasi Lemak:
Rice was coconutty (delicious!) used basmati rice i assume
Ikan Bilis - Fried and crispy
Beef salted egg - Gonna be honest i love beef and it was my first time eating it with salted egg. However, i got to say they made it worked. It was delicious, addictive, and tender.
Sambal - For me personally it was not on the spicy side, but it had the sweet and salty taste that was needed. Dont really eat sambal so honestly i cant say much ????

Sorry i cant say much about the Indo Maggi cause my buddy devoured it! All he said was, ?¨FBro, just let me eat, its delicious.?ºô

The dishes each were anchored on a familiar local flavour - such as their take on kueh pie tee, or congee with lap cheong, but were also incredibly inventive and complex. We felt this helped to elevate them above the often routine ?¨Ftartlets?ºô and ?¨Ffoams?ºô we?£¦ve had at other restaurants which often seem to fade from memory.

The restaurant is mostly counter seating and this brought both staff and kitchen front and centre in the entire experience. Chef Wai Leong and his team gave the best service we could ever ask for, and we were entertained by Chef?£¦s personal and amusing anecdotes throughout the evening.

We smelled a pungent smell of gas as soon as we entered the door. Out of concern for the safety of our meal, we politely asked the waiter to go to the kitchen to check.

Asked the staff if we could change and they told us we will be notified once available. Then came a couple after we asked to change seats and they also asked to change seats to the ones inside. They sat outside for awhile and in the end the cleared table was given to them without even notifying us.
The weather was hot and humid and there wasn't even a fan at our table. Halfway through our meal, the rain suddenly came and contaminated everything on our table including the food but was only brushed off with a ?¨F2?o?ô~a???ºô.

Also, the fire for the heating pad which is supposed to keep our food warm wasn't even lighted up properly. We only found out after finishing our first round of skewers.

Hot pot restaurant ,FALSE,FALSE,tan soo fei,0,1128,5,Haidilao,4.7,"The experience was disappointing. Sometimes, we can?£¦t avoid hiccups along the way. I had informed your staff that I might be late, providing an estimated arrival time of 7:30 PM. However, I received a call stating they could not hold the table for that long because they needed it back by 8:30 PM.

I am quite frustrated with this situation. I was asked to pay a deposit of $200 for my reservation of 13 people. I was initially hesitant because I knew there would be separate billing among the group, but I went ahead and paid the deposit. Given this, I expected your staff to be more accommodating regarding the timing. You request payment upfront, yet it seems your staff was unable to reciprocate.

Upon my arrival, one of your staff members made an inappropriate remark: ""Ni eh, dorang yang lambat?"" This comment was not acceptable.

I had to rush through my meal, turning the birthday dinner into a hurried experience. When it was time to pay, the bill was presented as a single receipt. I had already informed your staff that the $200 deposit should only offset my portion of the bill. Splitting the payment was inconvenient, especially since the meals did not include tax and GST, which I had to calculate separately.

Your staff could have found a solution at that moment. I believe I am not the only patron making reservations from 7 PM to 8:30 PM.

If I had known this would be so rigid, I would have chosen to make a reservation elsewhere.",0,0,0

Hot pot restaurant ,FALSE,FALSE,Dylan Lee,14,1128,5,Haidilao,4.7,"I've been a regular Haidilao customer and have enjoyed dining at several branches in Singapore. However, the free manicure at this branch in August 2025 was my most disappointing experience.

?? Excessive Waiting Time
It's clearly stated on weekends that nail polish removal is not available and the average waiting time is 35 minutes per person, but I waited for nearly three hours. One number was stuck for two hours before I was finally informed that someone else was removing their nails. There's a clear inconsistency between the rules and enforcement.

?? Rude Techniques + Poor Attitude
When it was my turn, I was first rushed by phone. The manicurist wasn't there when I arrived, so I waited for over ten minutes. During this time, they impatiently refused to let me refer to the designs on the wall. They clearly told me not to cut my nails short, but they still cut my thumb to the point where there was no free white edge, which disrupted my daily routine. The coloring process was frequently rushed, the lighting was insufficient, and the paint didn't get cleaned up after it was applied to my skin.

?? Poor experience in the public areas

While checking my iPad during a meal, a black-uniformed employee took it from me and began using it without any explanation or consultation.

? The only positive point

The pink-uniformed women in the backroom were very attentive, providing meticulous service and a clear handover.

I have emailed Haidilao customer service with the full details and provided the requested information, hoping the brand will handle this professionally and responsibly. However, I have yet to receive a response.

I am deeply disappointed with the brand's handling of this situation.

The ambient was simple, not over elaborated to fit the Latin steak it served. Conducive is the word for the purpose of most visits, I'd believe.

The food was fantastic! Tentalizing with bomb of favours. I couldn't resist the various flavor exchanging and transiting from the Queen of steak with their own special chimichuri sauce, to the side of Brussel sprouts and complimentary cocktail, born from the barista creation.

Steak was rich in favour, sufficient seasoning allowing one to indulge the flavor of the steak cut even without the sauce. However I'd highly recommend the sauces which elevate the flavour profile allowing one to enjoy while providing different pleasant experience.

Above all else, as if the food alone isn't enough to give it a 5 star rating, the service and the crew are the main highlight of this oasis. They were attentive to all of their customers while we indulge ourselves in our food. Their attention to customers need goes beyond a simple food joint. It goes without saying that the attention and prompt service provided the ideal atmosphere for a holistic enjoyment.

The food? Always satisfying. The flavours are bold yet balanced, and the presentation is just the cherry on top. Whether it's a quick bite or a full-on feast, Brio delivers every single time. Their menu strikes the perfect chord between variety and quality ?a a rare combination that makes each meal memorable.

But what truly sets Brio apart is the consistent warmth ?a both in the service and the atmosphere. It's the kind of place that feels like home, but better. You walk in and you're greeted not just with a smile, but with a sense of familiarity and care that?£¦s hard to find.

Had the Cream pasta and their signature prawn tomato pasta. Cream pasta was bland.   Prawn tomato was alright. Their local fried rice was average.

Was surprised the shop has not taken steps to be more transparent with the customers about the pricing of their special pork chop even after a couple of reviews left here about it.

Server was still introducing the item to customers and there was no mention of price nor is it on the menu.

I was one of those who had ordered and not known about the price back then. I had told the server to be inform customer about the price. It should be updated on their specials menu at the main door which they had back then. Yes, customer should have asked but for a shop at the heartlands, 36 bucks would not be a figure you are expecting.

If you are interested to order, my first impression of it was it tasted more like crispy pata than pork chop.
Apple sauce to pair with it was nice. But not sufficient for one to pay that much.

We wanted to get the ?¨FValue Set for 2?ºô but realized it requires ordering one ramen and one rice dish. We wish there was an option to order two ramen instead.

Anyway, we tried the Double Niku Ramen Set and the Supreme Kata Chashu Ramen Set, both of which came with a side dish and a drink. We also ordered extra Nankotsu and Chashu.

While the extra Nankotsu ($6.20) was a little pricey, it was very tender and the portion was quite decent. However, the extra Chashu ($2.50) was disappointing - a small, thin slice.

The side dish we chose - gyoza - was tasty, though we wished it was crispier.

Hot tomato has changed their menu.  The mushroom soup and tomatoes soup are still delicious as ever.  The fish and chips is a little bland, can be a little saltier. Otherwise takes with tartar sauce is just right.

The best part is the cleanliness ?a both the room and the shared toilet were very clean, and it seems like regular cleaning is done, which is great.

The location is also very strategic, close to many key places, so it's convenient for getting around.

That said, the room layout could be improved. The corridor inside the room is extremely narrow ?a only one person can walk through at a time, which makes moving around a bit tricky. Also, the main door opens inward, and if someone is climbing up to their bed, the door can swing and hit them if another guest enters at the same time.

Storage space is limited. Only two of the four guests can store their luggage under the beds inside the room. The other two have to use lockers located outside the room, which is less convenient.

We had a baby with us and were very shocked to see the totally inappropriate welcome gift for him, a large cellophane blow up balloon . Totally inappropriate and unsafe, as it could scare him when it popped and small particles could be a choking hazard. The cot provided was very old and even though the hotel is historical, the items they provide for a a baby should be updated.

?	Check-in and room allocation: The room layout was unsafe for families. The TV was positioned in a way that required pulling it towards the bed, creating a risk for a small child. I raised this with reception within 5 minutes of checking in, but the staff said, ?¨Fwe can?£¦t do anything.?ºô They even blamed me for booking that room, even though no layout was provided during booking. Their only solution was to pay more to change rooms.
?	Breakfast issue: Our booking clearly included breakfast for 2 adults and 1 child. On the first morning, the restaurant staff rudely insisted only 1 person was included. I showed the booking confirmation on the hotel?£¦s own app, but reception still refused to honor it. I ended up paying almost $200 extra for breakfasts. What made this worse is that even after paying, their system was never updated. Every single morning, we had to explain the same issue at the restaurant, then go back to reception to bring someone to confirm we had already paid. This was embarrassing, frustrating, and showed how poorly the hotel managed guest services.
?	Room electrical problems: On 3 different days, the room lights kept switching off while the aircon stayed on. Reception dismissed this, saying it was ?¨Fsensor activity.?ºô Only after I pressed firmly on the third day did they send an electrician, who found a faulty sensor. No apology was offered.
?	Housekeeping: Housekeeping service was inconsistent. On some days, the room was left uncleaned despite requests. The staff themselves were polite and hardworking, but it seemed like poor management was the issue.

This was my third stay at this property (previously Parkroyal), but the change to Novotel has been a huge step backwards. Staff at reception were unprofessional and showed no willingness to solve problems.

I would be fine if the staff informed us that the dining time limit was a hard rule, and if they informed us that there is 10 minutes left and if we would like to settle the bill, but to try and subtly hint and pressure us is unprofessional.

The hotel was a huge disappointment. The hotel design & room decor are poor:
(1) the reception area is cramped & during check in/out, people & bags impede access to the restaurant
(2) the restaurant is so small (& cramped) that it's necessary to wait in a queue for a table at breakfast
(3) combined, the reception/restaurant area is noisy & difficult to navigate.
(4) my room, a ""Superior Queen"" was so small that l had to step sideways between my suitcase & the bed - a gap of max 30cm
(5) the bathroom was so small that, when sitting on the lavatory, l could touch the facing wall of the room & shower door/wall, while the toilet paper holder was high on the wall BEHIND & above the lavatory. I estimate the size of the bathroom (ie shower stall + lavatory) at ~ 1.5m in each direction. I felt claustrophobic in the bathroom
(6) the room had a large round mirror with a switch on its surface which, when touched, lit up the outer ring of the mirror. When this ring light was switched off, the switch itself emited a bright blue light that could not be turned off or disabled. The room glowed bright blue all night & disturbed my sleep for the duration of my stay
(7) the bed was rock hard, like a solid surface without a mattress. My home mattress is extra firm & feels like a marshmallow by comparison.

One downside is that the hotel is located next to a restaurant, so some noise from outside can be heard in the room. The hotel provides free earplugs upon request at the lobby, which is a nice touch.

They also offer luggage storage both before check-in and after check-out, which is very convenient if you arrive early and want to explore or shop before getting your room.",0,0,0

Imagine.. none of us ( 4 people ) realize that our bag was lost just after that moment !!  It was about 5 - 15 minutes since we've entered and did some experiments..
Too cool that can make us forget that important stuff. He gave it to me,  and asked me to check the inside. Our 3 passports, credit cards, money were all still there.. Biggest thank to FAIZAL, for the kindness and the willingness on helping us since we've entered the Customer Service office.

The room is a decent size ?a not too small ?a and the price is quite reasonable by Singapore standards (around 3,500 THB per night). Overall, it?£¦s a good value option for this area. However, there are a few downsides: although I booked a single large bed, it turned out to be two smaller beds pushed together with a topper on top, leaving a noticeable gap in the middle, which made sleeping a bit uncomfortable.

?? In the bathroom, the sink was cracked, and the chair in the room was unstable ?a it kept falling apart and needed to be reassembled repeatedly. Due to these maintenance issues, I would deduct one star from my overall rating.

?? Location & Accessibility
The biggest advantage of this hotel is its location. It is the closest hotel to Paya Lebar MRT station, compared to others in the area. It?£¦s also just a short walk to PLQ Mall, Paya Lebar Square, and SingPost Centre.

? I used to live and work in this neighborhood, so I chose this hotel specifically to revisit some of my favorite local food spots. For that purpose, the location was perfect.

The staff were friendly and helpful. They allowed me to check in early as soon as I arrived and also provided luggage storage before check-in and after check-out, which was very convenient.",0,0,0

The descent from the Bukit Timah Peak has several steep flights of stairs and it tends to be popular with people doing trail running activities.

The entire concept is beautifully executed?ait's not just a zoo or a park, but a space that invites you to slow down, observe, and appreciate the diversity of birdlife in a meaningful way.

The two bird presentations were definite highlights. They weren?£¦t just flashy performances; they were well-paced, informative, and surprisingly funny at times. The trainers clearly know their birds well, and the way they wove in conservation messages without being preachy was impressive. I learned things I didn?£¦t expect to, and the kids around me were fully engaged too?awhich says a lot.

The layout of the park is intuitive and immersive. Each aviary feels like a different world, and the transitions between zones are smooth and natural. I especially appreciated the attention to detail in the signage?aclear, concise, and multilingual. It?£¦s obvious that a lot of thought went into making this accessible to a wide range of visitors.

What stood out most was the atmosphere. It?£¦s peaceful, clean, and well-maintained, with plenty of shaded areas and resting spots. You don?£¦t feel rushed or overwhelmed. It?£¦s the kind of place where you can take your time, reflect, and just enjoy being surrounded by nature.

Overall, Bird Paradise exceeded my expectations. It?£¦s a place I?£¦d recommend to anyone?afamilies, educators, tourists, or just someone looking for a quiet, enriching day out.

Hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,Robie Concepcion,191,3390,1,ibis Styles Singapore On Macpherson,3.7,"Choosing the right accommodation during a trip can make or break a travel experience, and my two-night stay in Singapore left me with mixed feelings.
The positives I can see include the room amenities, which are quite complete. Even though I had to ask for more at the information counter, I can assume the hotel has the necessary essentials. At least I don't have to worry about missing basic necessities. Another significant saving is the free shuttle service to Paya Lebar MRT Station at 11:00 AM. This is a great option for those who don't rent a car or want to save on taxi fares. Furthermore, there are several bus lines around the hotel, making it relatively convenient to get around the city, even though the hotel is quite far from the city center.

Disappointing: Attention-grabbing details. However, my impression began to diminish with some seemingly overlooked details. First, the room size was quite small, considering the price per night. Travelers who prefer comfortable living space might find it a bit cramped. Water was another issue that required adjustment, as refilling it yourself was required on the 4th floor, and after 10:00 PM, refilling it was required downstairs. While not a major issue, it was a significant inconvenience. But perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the room cleaning policy. The hotel clearly stated that rooms would be cleaned for guests starting on the third night.
This meant that, for those staying for only two nights, like me, the room would not be cleaned at all throughout my stay. Even though the room wasn't cleaned during the first two nights, the hotel did replace the towels, which is crucial for a clean and comfortable stay.
The most disgusting aspect was the condition of the kettle in the room. There was a yellow stain on it. I tried to wipe it off, but it looked like a stubborn stain, similar to a nasty tooth tartar stain. This made me question why the room wasn't cleaned with a cleaning solution and thoroughly scrubbed the equipment that guests usually use.

Conclusion: Is it worth it? (For those who might return) In summary, despite the hotel's positive amenities, acceptable transportation, and the excellent service of the hotel staff, the overall experience was undermined by disappointing cleanliness standards and an inflexible room cleaning policy. The issue of stains on the kettle, in particular, demonstrated a lack of attention to small but crucial details in the hotel business. Overall, Despite some disappointing experiences, if we ever need to return to Singapore, this hotel is a viable option for a one-night stay. This is for temporary stays and doesn't require full service in terms of room cleanliness. For SGD 180 per night, guests expect more than a cramped room and unclean amenities. If you're looking for a hotel in Singapore and prioritize cleanliness and service, it might be a better idea to consider other options.

all the food we ordered was way beyond our expeditions.
- rib eye steak
- seafood risotto
- beef burger
- beef bolognese
-fish and chips
-luncheon fries
-honey truffle wings

even brought a 2yo to dine and they were very friendly and even accommodated to his unlimited supply of popcorns.

mistook the white hair server as the boss cause she was damn passionate and detailed orientated. she even remember who ordered what food.

the rest of the floor staff were also very welcoming, they smiled through the entire service even tho they were busy (went back multiple times to ask for a rock glass and they just smile and gave it to us)

the live band today was fabulous and very very sharp. they notice us singing quietly a happy birthday song and they caught on and even sang for my friend.

Most value for my money western set lunches tend to be quite compromised is terms of quality, quantity and attention to detail, but not here.

Soup of the day was Pumpkin soup and was deliciously creamy and pumpkin sweet but yet not cloying. My starter of grilled broccoli looked plain but was perfectly grilled (not dry and retaining the juicy crunch) with the aroma of smokiness and seasoned with a touch of rosemary salt.

Both main courses of Fish and Chip and Char Grilled chicken may look ordinary but again I can't find fault with the perfectly deep fried crunchy batter and juicy fish, and the lovely chargrilled smokey tender juicy chicken.
My wife typically doesn't touch the fries but she almost finished all of it. No sauce required at all. This is how you do fries right.
The salad was fresh and just the right amount of dressing.

Both the chocolate cake and lemon butter cake were ok, but the main course and starters were the real stars.

Park Tourist attraction,FALSE,TRUE,Jan,861,361,4,Ann Siang Hill Park,4.2,"Tiny oasis on the edge of Chinatown. Loads of history in such a small place.
Ann Siang Hill was originally known as?Scott's Hill, after its original owner Charles Scott, who cultivated?nutmegs?and?cloves?in the area.[1]?It was later sold to?John Gemmill, a merchant and former?auctioneer, and was renamed as?Gemmill's Hill.[2]?It was then sold to Chia in 1873 and renamed to Ann Siang Hill.[3]

Chia joined the?British?firm?Boustead and Company?in 1848. The company traded in?natural resources,?spices,?coconut,?tobacco,?tin,?tea?and?silk. After eight years on the job, Chia was promoted to chief produce storekeeper. He retired in 1890 after over 40 years of service in the company, and went into the?timber?business. He also became a partner of the firm Geok Teat and Company in 1863. After he became a wealthy landowner and one of the leading merchants of his time, he acquired both Gemmill's Hill and?Mount Erskine.

The hill was known as?qing shan ting?to the local Chinese.[1]?The early Chinese immigrants visited Ann Siang Hill when they wanted to send money home to their families in China, as it was the traditional site of?remittance?houses. Letter writers and calligraphers also had their businesses at the?five-foot way?of the?shophouses?to help the illiterate immigrants write letters home.

Most of the houses in Ann Siang Hill and along Ann Siang Road were built between 1903 and 1941. Ann Siang Road, which has elegantly?restored?shophouses today, was once the traditional home of?clan associations?and exclusive social?clubs

Greenery abounds.
Many access points around the perimeter.
Provides a shortcut path between Maxwell and Chinatown.
Restrooms are non-existent.
Handicap possible, but there are stairs at several access points.
Final take.....nice teeny parklet.
Great walk for Singapore history buffs.

I'd previously enjoyed a resort stay at Marina Bay Sands, so I chose this hotel for its convenience. I have a Hilton AMEX card and booked it using my complimentary stay benefit. I could have also chosen the Conrad Orchard, but a friend told me it was on the outskirts of Orchard, so I chose this one. I'm an Honors Gold member, and I received an email upgrading me to an Executive Room the day before. A friend drove me home, but I had trouble finding the driveway, so I ended up in the underground parking lot. From there, I took the elevator to the front desk. I was able to choose my room number online in advance, but I accidentally chose the opposite side, even though I wanted the Orchard side. When I asked about the direction at check-in, they kindly explained to me the room I had chosen, not the Orchard side, but the building directly in front of me. They told me that there were no rooms available in this category on the Orchard side, but they offered a room one grade lower, on a higher floor, on the Orchard side, even though it didn't actually have access to the lounge. They kindly offered me a room with the lounge access, even though it didn't. (It seemed like no one there spoke Japanese, so basic conversation was in English.) || The room was small, but it overlooked Orchard Road. There was a building across the street, and the sunrise I saw on the day of my departure was beautiful. || It's located inside a shopping mall, and I often come to this building because it's home to Chatterbox, a famous chicken rice restaurant, and until recently, a cute souvenir shop run by a Japanese woman. Orchard Road is right outside, so it's really convenient for shopping. It was the perfect place to stay the night before my departure. || They included a lounge, so I went there too. It's quite spacious, and while there isn't a huge selection of food, it's still a nice place to relax. || I had an early departure the next morning, so I skipped breakfast, but I received Hilton points for it. || On the day I was leaving, I discovered the driveway. There are many different elevators, so it might be a bit difficult to find. || After checking out, I remembered I'd left something in my room and went to the front desk.

Dear Hilton Singapore Orchard Team,

I recently attended my company D&D at your hotel recently. Unfortunately, I found the catering experience to be well below the standard I have come to expect from the Hilton brand.

Specifically:

Dishes lacked flavor and freshness. Food was tasteless.

Temperature control was poor ?a some hot items were lukewarm on arrival.

Presentation felt rushed and unappealing for a venue of Hilton?£¦s calibre.

I understand that banquet service has different logistics from restaurant dining, but even within those constraints, the quality on this occasion was disappointing. Given Hilton?£¦s strong reputation, I was expecting a higher standard.

I hope this feedback will be shared with your banquet kitchen and event management teams so that future guests enjoy a dining experience that truly reflects the Hilton brand promise.

Sincerely,",0,0,0

Expect to get wet from waist down.
----

Went there on a weekday afternoon. It was non peak and there were in total 5 dogs including my own. (I think the nearby dog boarding brings the dogs there too)

Gate only opened when the time slot is open. Staff did a check on the vaccination record before letting me enter.

He did not offer a life vest for my dog till I asked for it. Another guest also didn't know till she saw me asking for it. Maybe good to inform/ask guest upfront.
(My dog fell into a pool as she run around excitedly but managed to climb out herself. So do get the life vest for ur dog at the start).

Staff was helpful to give me tips as it was my first time there and my dog was freaking out in the water. He also gave some treats too, which really helped. Thanks!

Pool area:
- Main pool: Shallow waters (mid-calf level) which slopes into deeper water (waist level).
- Shallow water area is quite a good big area for dogs that don't swim but yet can play and jumping around the water.
- Second smaller, deeper pool is for big dogs to swim in.
- Toys and floats are available for them to play.

Facilities:
- Changing stalls is literally 3 tents with curtains that do not shut properly as well.
- Shower area is open area with taps and shower heads. A bit hard to control my dog in the open so I gave up halfway.
- Drying area. It's outside the pool area, along the common walkway, just 2 plugs there. I can imagine if there's a crowd you won't be able to use it.
- Visibly see algae/green stuff floating around the base of the pool. Not for fussy owners.

We are currently staying at this hotel for 8 nights. We booked it for three reasons (French hotel chain, to run our businesses, and to use our All account).

We checked into our room yesterday around 5:00 PM and encountered two initial problems:
- Our rewards points, which had been deducted when we booked, were not deducted upon arrival. After checking, we had to return to reception to get the difference refunded.
- The room was dirty (trash not emptied, hair on the bathroom floor, dish soap stains in the sink). We asked reception, with photos attached, to come and clean the room.

We left to meet up with family, and when we returned around 9:30 PM, nothing had been done?- We returned to reception to ask for the necessary cleaning! Someone came at 9:45 PM. We're with an 11-month-old baby, so you can imagine the situation...

This morning, after walking a few steps in the room, our feet were black. Wanting to be polite and not pushy, I pressed the alarm to have the room cleaned today.
When I got back this evening at 9:30 p.m., the alarm was still on and the room wasn't cleaned!
We had to go back to reception again, and they explained to me that this was normal because housekeeping is done every other day, but that they apologized for the situation and that the necessary work would be done tomorrow!

Finally, if we want to be really picky and annoying, our room doesn't look like the one in the photo when we booked, obviously the oldest one. Furthermore, there's masking tape (used for painting) on the ceiling in the bathroom, paint on the bed base and floor...

??? Room & Amenities The amenities are extremely basic?aonly toothbrush and hand soap were provided. There were instances where towels were unavailable due to limited stock. The walls are noticeably thin; we could clearly hear sounds from neighboring rooms, which affected our comfort and sleep.

?? Cleanliness & Pest Control This was the most concerning aspect of our stay. Despite deep cleaning, we repeatedly encountered cockroaches throughout our stay. This points to poor pest control management, which made the stay feel unhygienic. Housekeeping also only occurred on alternate days and was quite inconsistent.

On 13 June 2025, my home caught fire early in the morning. My girlfriend and I barely escaped, losing nearly all our belongings within minutes. We were in shock, with nothing but our pyjamas, a partially burnt passport, and our three pets (a hamster and two guinea pigs) ?a who we managed to save. My girlfriend was admitted to NUH A&E, and a friend kindly booked a room at this hotel for me, as it was nearby. The purpose was simple: to briefly shelter the pets while I returned to the hospital.

When I arrived, visibly distressed, I was greeted by a staff member named Audrey. Despite our clear emergency and the hotel having been informed by phone in advance, I was coldly told ?¨Fno pets?ºô ?a without any effort to understand the context or offer a humane solution. I explained that I just needed a few hours of safe space to regroup and return to the hospital, that I was willing to pay extra cleaning fees, and that the animals were secured in proper carriers. Still, the response was robotic and dismissive.

There was no offer of water, support, or even the simplest courtesy like ?¨Fare you okay??ºô ?a only repeated policy enforcement. In contrast, every other organisation we dealt with in the aftermath ?a from SCDF to our landlord, even telcos and delivery companies ?a responded with empathy and flexibility. This hotel was the only place that treated us without basic decency.

I fully understand policies exist. But compassion should, at times, override rules, especially in extreme and rare circumstances. I left feeling more shaken than when I arrived, and the stress worsened the health of our pets that day.

If you?£¦re looking for a hotel that treats guests with humanity ?a especially in emergencies ?a I cannot recommend this one. Our experience stands out in contrast to the overwhelming kindness we received from everyone else.",0,0,0

From the golf courses, the villas, pools and more.. everything seems like a fantasy but hey, its worth noting that this place is accepting guests.. we did abit of walking around the place as well and were impressed at the layout and designs of the whole venue. It was really planned out well..

Lets dive in!

Rooms:
We managed to see inside the rooms but felt that its actually similar to every hotel that we had been to before. So its a 5 star nonetheless

Service:
There are some small downsides where staff, when approached, didnt even smile but looked disgruntled.. but again, maybe its due to the heat of the area. We gona give a 5 as the rest of the staff we met, made our day with smiles and professionalism. Lunch was sumptuous but unfortunately not halal.. so we were quite challenged.. we had sushi and salad

Location:
Slightly further to end of the road. If u had been to Newater, then its a similar direction just a deviate at certain junction. The whole place has an aura of exclusivity..

We really enjoyed our time here and if the food had a halal section or fully halal, it would be the best actually.

All in all, we would recommend to stay here, for u to unwind away from the hassle and dazzle of Singapore, within Singapore. Just 1 downside of the whole place, u will need to arrange transport in/out as there is no public buses/trains ready yet.

Resort hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,Appreciated Images,223,2848,3,Siloso Beach Resort,4.1,"There really isn't a single thing that's good about this place. Everything about it is terrible.
I had high expectations because of the many good reviews on Agoda.

My pregnant wife and I decided to go to Singapore for a prenatal care trip, so we booked a room for just under 200,000 won per night. From the moment we arrived, I couldn't help but question whether we were getting what we paid for.
The resort building and surrounding structures felt like they were stuck in the 90s, and I was shocked when I entered the room.
The interior of the room felt very old, and the refrigerator was worn, with peeling paint and rust everywhere.

The air conditioner in the room was so dusty that I don't know when it was last cleaned. The thermostat was a ridiculous dial-type thermostat that looked like it might have been used in the 80s or 90s. No matter how hard I turned it on, the room never cooled down. I told the front desk that the room was hot, and a technician came over shortly after and checked the temperature with a laser thermometer. The air conditioning was at 16 degrees, but the bed was at 25 degrees, and the floor was at 23 degrees. It was an incredible, unbelievable phenomenon.

Then, after telling me to wait a moment, another employee came back with a fan. He said the resort's air conditioning is centrally controlled, so there's a set minimum temperature, and all the other rooms are the same. So, what's the point of a thermostat?

And the fan they brought was truly a sight to behold.
My wife is pregnant, so we have to be careful with everything. The fan kept accumulating dust, and if I used it, I'd probably get lung disease. I asked if they brought it just for me to use, and they said it worked fine and turned it on. I immediately turned it off. I asked if they brought it with all this dust for a pregnant woman to use, and they said they had brought the last one and there was nothing they could do about it, so I just told them to leave.

I was absolutely dumbfounded.

There were two bottles of water in the room, but after drinking them all, I asked the housekeeper for more. They told me to ask the front desk for water, and I had to go to the water dispensers on the 1st, 7th, and 8th floors to refill them.
I realized I'd misunderstood, so I went to the front desk and asked for more. They said they only provided two bottles for the entire stay and that I had to fetch any more bottles myself.
Is this typical service for a place that costs nearly 200,000 won per night? Incidentally, they didn't even mention that when we first checked in. So we just bought water.

The water quality was truly surprising.
At first, the shower pressure was weak, so we replaced it with a filter showerhead we'd brought just in case. But within a day, the filter had discolored.
The water quality was so bad that I wasn't even angry anymore.
I just felt like I'd wasted my money.

My husband and I's room was on the second floor, and they gave us a room with two single beds. When I asked if they had a double bed, they said they had no double beds and that we had to move the beds together ourselves.
Our room was on the second floor, so it was low, and even if we wanted to look outside, people outside could see right through our room if they turned their heads. There were no inner curtains on the windows, so we had to use blackout curtains, so we couldn't see anything outside during our stay.

The building and room smelled musty, and when we woke up in the morning, we saw ants, and both my husband and I had bug bites that we thought were ant bites.

I'll say it again: we paid nearly 200,000 won per night.

It was truly the worst of the worst.
This was my first time in Singapore, and the previous accommodations here were comparable in price to this one. The room condition, service, water quality, hygiene, and cleanliness were all incomparable.
The stories about Singapore being a developed country and being clean were great until I arrived here, but they were all shattered the moment I arrived.

2. Excellent location with free shuttles to several stops, including the monorail that connects you to the island and VivoCity.
3. An incredible natural pool, sourced from an underground stream.
4. Many attractions are a short walk away.
5. BEST croissants ever for hotel breakfast
6. Free Eco tour. My child enjoyed so much as its so educational for kids",0,0,0

Without even asking us, the front desk just handed us two key cards for two single rooms. When we expressed confusion, we thought they might not know we are a couple, so we emphasized our relationship. But they just casually replied that the room type we booked was no longer available and they could offer breakfast as compensation. Seriously? We booked a double bed room ?a not two single rooms! And they didn?£¦t even bother to ask if we were okay with the change ?a just made the decision for us!

We refused to accept it, and only after insisting did they finally give us a double bed room. That?£¦s when we realized the hotel actually did have double bed rooms available ?a they just wanted guests to help them get rid of their hard-to-sell rooms first. This kind of trick is outrageous and unacceptable.

What made it even worse was the front desk saying, ?¨FThis room is even better than the one you originally booked,?ºô like they were doing us a favor.

BTW the bathroom in the room we finally got had a glass door that wouldn?£¦t even close properly ¡ùC it stayed wide open with a visible gap. You could see the toilet clearly from the bed, offering zero privacy.

Hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,cvsurya permatajaya,2,2387,1,Travelodge Harbourfront,4,"My family and I stayed for six nights and had a truly comfortable stay. The location was excellent, just two MRT stops from Chinatown and a five-minute walk from the monorail to Sentosa. I also took the MRT to and from the airport, which took just over an hour.

The proximity to the MRT and bus stops, along with easy access to VivoCity, supermarkets, and convenience stores, were a major draw. The Wi-Fi was stable and fast, making it a hassle-free experience.

The pool was simple but clean and adequate. Towels were always readily available, making it a pleasant experience. The breakfast staff were diligent in cleaning and serving the food. Although the selection was limited, the relaxing atmosphere allowed us to enjoy our breakfast every morning.

The front desk and cleaning staff were also very friendly, with smiles and attentive service throughout. My son, who is in elementary school, said he wanted to come back, making this a memorable stay for our family.

However, there were some aspects that were not fully explained, which left us feeling a little confused at times.
For example, I was confused several times as to whether the ""green cleaning button"" in my room indicated a request for cleaning or a signal that cleaning was not required due to environmental considerations. It also wasn't clear whether mineral water was provided daily or only on the first day, which slightly affected my shopping at the supermarket (it was actually only provided on the first day).

At breakfast, I was suddenly asked ""What's your room number?"" every time. If it was a self-report system, I think it would have been smoother and more comfortable if they had informed me at check-in or in the dining area.

Also, the late check-out at 12:00 is a very appreciated service, so I felt a mention of this at the outset would have given me more peace of mind.

However, these are minor points, and I have mentioned them in the hope that they will be improved. Considering the value for money, location, and staff service, I think this was a truly excellent hotel. I am truly grateful for the hospitality during my stay. Thank you very much.",0,0,0

Hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,Trip.com Member,,1093,,Hotel 81 Tristar,3.9,"We had an okay stay here during our July trip to Singapore. Main complaint = bad service and filth.
PROS:
1) The location is pretty good. It takes less than 10 minutes to get to Paya Lebar MRT station and the PLQ mall. There are tons of food options around the area, and there?£¦s even a convenience store by the entrance of the hotel.
2) The room we had was pretty spacious. We had lots of space to mobilize easily and open our luggage.

CONS:
1) The service is not very good here. I have multiple experiences to support my argument. FIRST, the moment we arrived at the hotel, we were not greeted at all by the receptionist (we greeted him, and there was no response) who seemed Asian and a bit old, with a frowny, annoying face. The first thing he said was, ?¨FAll passports (in a rude, commanding intonation).?ºô No good morning, no ?¨Fhow are you doing??ºô. At first I thought, oh, he must be tired since it was midnight and a graveyard shift. But I realized that this should NOT be an excuse. In the tons of hotels we?£¦ve stayed at in the past, even at midnight, we are always greeted. It?£¦s basic customer service. It wouldn?£¦t hurt to say good morning or SMILE at least. SECOND, we specifically asked for our room to be cleaned and for the bedsheets, towels, etc. to be replaced (we hung the tag on the doorknob). However, when we came back, it was not cleaned at all. Nothing was replaced or changed. We called the front desk afterwards to clean our room. They did not apologize at all for their shortcoming, and all they said was, ?¨Fokay we will send housekeeping [end of call].?ºô It took about 1.5 hours for them to arrive. However, the housekeeping staff who helped us throughout our stay was the one polite staff in this entire hotel. This staff helped us with our requests, and was very helpful. THIRD, we kinda felt like ghosts throughout our stay. Whenever we entered or exited, the front desk staff just continued gossiping and chatting while staring at their computers, completely ignoring us. When we checked out, they did not thank us for staying with them. Maybe it was a certain batch of staff? Idk.
2) There were some large brown spots of dirt on the bathtub. It looked like it wasn?£¦t cleaned for a while. It was kinda disgusting, as it looked like it could possibly be??.
3) There were inconsiderate guests shouting and yelling at the hallway at night, making it quite difficult to relax/sleep.

Hmmm, mainly, it seems like Hotel 81 Tristar has a problem with a certain batch of front desk staff. Consider training these guys to at least have some basic customer service skills. This hotel has potential due its pros, but consider solving your cons. Would?£¦ve wanted to stay here again especially due to its location, but the cons made us not want to stay here again.",0,0,0

Serviced accommodation ,FALSE,FALSE,Trip.com Member,,128,,Citadines Connect Rochester Singapore,4.3,"I stayed at Citadines Connect Rochester for a period of almost three months. I would describe the stay as overall pleasant, however, there have been multiple issues throughout it that I'd like to share.

Starting off with the room, I stayed at the Premier room on the 7th floor. The space is utilized incredibly well, however the ventilation and lack of air flow made it, at times, almost unlivable for me. The lack of windows and an odor coming from the bathroom (shower) had me lose sleep and avoid my room more often than not, especially nearing the end of my stay. Staff was contacted on the issue and while they really tried to help (both engineers and cleaning staff), the smell stayed persistent. Cooking was also very useful in theory - but any sort of food smell would fill up the room for hours due to bad ventilation. Otherwise, the room was spacious and comfortable.

Secondly, I have a few comments on the services and staff. While everyone has been friendly and helpful, I have been disturbed with phone calls to an alarming degree. These calls were mainly regarding room cleaning - though I was very clear on having my room cleaned every other day, and whenever the room was on do not disturb, to not go in. This wasn't respected and I was called over and over to confirm room cleaning. Further I have gotten calls at unsolicited hours of the night, one example being a call at 10PM regarding a gift being sent to my room for Women's Day. Unfortunately, room cleaning was also not properly done at times. More than once my sheets were not changed, or changed with new stained sheets.

Another third occurrence I'd like to share is being charged for a towel. Apparently the towel had an unremovable stain and I was charged for it as cleaning staff could not get the stain off. The stain was from a soda drink, which I believe is quite easily washable. Whatever the case may be, I think charging someone who is living in the hotel for such a long-term period for a towel feels ridiculous. The charge was very low cost, but it left a bad impression on me.

There were good things, of course - the pool was great, the breakfast itself and breakfast staff were incredibly kind, location is convenient (close to public transport and Star Vista mall), reception girls were always really kind and tried to be helpful.

However, I'd unfortunately not stay there again, the biggest reason being the lack of air flow and the odor of my room. Perhaps if this was a shorter stay, my opinion would be different :)",0,0,0

2- no room service
3- the cleanliness of the hotel is the worst,
They don?£¦t change the sheets nor replace the bath/hand towels
4-I understand its a high sustainability hotel, so no water bottles in the rooms, you need to fill a jar by the hallways to get your water
5- the pool is terribly small
6- their restaurant closes at 8:30 PM and if you need the food to come to your room you have to pay extra
7- rooms are very small
8- no windows that can be opened for fresh air
9- to turn the high fan for the AC, it makes a terrible sound
10- to get fresh towels, u need to request through a scan bar code and a robot shall bring you your stuff. we waited more than 6 hours for the fresh towels and nothing came until we complained also you can?£¦t request more than one item even if you booked for double.

First of all, the teriyaki sauce is spot on. I would say that if you're a Japanese restaurant and your teriyaki sauce is not authentic or too salty, then you really shouldn't be opening a Japanese restaurant. I think most customers that visit other sub standard restaurants are too patronizing and maybe can't tell the difference of what's good or bad. So our many substandard YouTubers.

Here comes the stuffs that needs improvement. The Wagyu Hamburger $10.90 is not suitable to just be cooked with just teriyaki sauce. It should be cooked like the garlic prawns or meat with some soy based sauce. Then add some teriyaki sauce as a finishing touch to give it a elevated flavour. The management should do some taste test. On the paper it feels great but in reality it just fails the mark by a bit.

Next the prawns (7 for $12.90) is a great value. However, somewhere along the line, the prawn is not as fresh as expected.

Hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,MsBengah,36,343,1,Hotel Faber Park Singapore - Handwritten Collection,4.3,"Pros:
? Excellent location: The hotel has its own bus stop, with many lines serving the city center directly. It is also close to the cable car, making it an excellent starting point for sightseeing, including late or unplanned returns.
? Tasteful decor: The hotel's overall ambiance is pleasant, with modern and well-designed decor.
? Generally helpful staff: Although the attention sometimes varies depending on the age of the guests (less assistance for younger guests), the staff remains available and professional.
? Varied and high-quality breakfast: All-you-can-eat buffet combining Western and Asian options. The pancakes are particularly good. Service is fast and efficient, and tables are cleaned as soon as they become available.
? Quality coffee available: Real coffee (not an instant coffee machine), which is rare enough to be noted.
? Rooftop pool: Beautiful rooftop pool with clean water at a pleasant temperature. The pool, although shallow, is perfect for swimming laps. The view overlooks the ring road, so it's slightly noisy, but still pleasant.

?? Cons:
? Catastrophic soundproofing: The biggest drawback. The walls seem nonexistent; you can hear everything: conversations, children, neighbors in adjacent rooms or across the street. Rest becomes difficult, if not impossible.
? Incessant slamming of doors: The doors automatically close with a loud slam. On every floor, you hear these noises repeatedly, at all hours of the day and night, due to the large number of rooms.
? Breakfast drinks could be improved: The only real flaw in the buffet: the lack of fresh juice. The ""orange juice"" is chemical-like and unpleasant.

Conclusion:

A well-located and convenient hotel for exploring Singapore, with a great breakfast menu and interesting amenities like the rooftop pool. However, the lack of soundproofing is a major flaw that shouldn't exist in a 4-star hotel, especially at the price. Recommended for a dynamic or touristy stay, but avoid if you're looking for peace and quiet.",0,0,0

Across our stay, we called for a buggy nine times and only four arrived. Breakfast was poorly handled, with our order completely forgotten, multiple staff checking and retaking our order, but still, no food after almost 30+ minutes, and when it finally came one item was wrong.

Before sleeping, we asked for a bolster or similar and were told to use a pillow from the bed. We understand bolsters may not be stocked, but hugging a regular pillow is not the same for side sleeping, and there was no follow-up or alternative provided.

During in-villa dining at the Presidential Villa, our niece got badly bitten by mosquitoes. Staff said there was no insect repellent, yet our 2-Bedroom Villa later had a designer repellent spray provided by the hotel. This reflected a lack of staff knowledge and attentiveness.

One bedroom had no working power points, hence they need to go to the living room to dry their hair, and apparently when both hair dryers used together, they caused a power fault that cut lights, disabled the butler phone, and locked the living room aircon.

Also unfortunately, in our 2-Bedroom villa there was no wifi at all.

No turn-down service, I expected this should be given.

There were more issues overall, but these are the ones that remained unresolved. The rest were addressed with service recovery, though for a resort of this level they should not have occurred in the first place.

Excellent location, nice environment and patio.  Surprisingly spacious apartment but clear signs of wear and tear / age. A cupboard was falling off its hinges when we checked in and handyman came to fix it during our stay. Floor on first level strangely sticky and had stains. Kettle was dirty on check in, although staff rectified this when it was pointed out. Staff kindly gave us apartment tour and took time to guide us on use of stuff like hob and automatic curtains. Can probably cook, but mini-fridge had strange smell. For some reason, free coffee / tea was stored under the sink (where the pipes were). Main bed was excellent, floor to ceiling windows and swaying bamboo outside - pleasant views . Bathroom serviceable, shower pressure good but plumbing not great - toilet occasionally had sewage smell.  Amenities basic and not the ""luxurious selection of room supplies"" on the official Gardens by the Bay website.  Had to manually request room slippers, toothbrushes etc - apparently there was supposed to be an email to sent to guests to request these things beforehand but we never received the email (to give benefit of doubt, this may or may not be because we booked through Agoda).

All other pods look out into an enclosed yard, which means a lot more privacy. From Jasmine, you can sort of see the public walkway (through the trees), and part of the Jasmine living room doors are visible from the main thoroughfare. However, the part of GbtB that the Pods are located are very quiet; I was there over a weekend and I maybe saw 5-10 people walk past each day.

I believe the outdoor areas of some of the Pods are 'linked', in that you could walk from one to the other. But it's all cleverly designed and landscaped so you don't realise it, and it does feel private.

I was there for a birthday celebration, and had considered booking the entire compound so I could bring more guests. in case you're thinking of booking all 4 Pods for a big party, be prepared that each Pod is designed to feel quite self-contained, so effectively rather than one central party you'll likely end up with 4 satellite parties.

It is really unacceptable as a paying guest to be unable to use the common areas because the hotel is renting out the space to run external events.

I've stayed at other hotels under The Unlimited Collection by Ascott?aAnn Siang House and Wanderlust?aand those were fine. But this? This was A TOTAL DISASTER.

Let?£¦s talk about the soundproofing?aor lack thereof. It?£¦s NON EXISTENT. We were in Room 216, right next to the door connecting the common room to the corridor. Every single time someone came or went, it felt like getting SLAPPED AWAKE. And from upstairs? You hear everything: footsteps, showers, even someone turning in bed. It?£¦s like the walls and ceilings were made of cardboard.

Never in my life of hotel stays have I felt more like I was SLEEPING ON THE STREET ?awhile paying hotel prices.

To make it worse, reception was nowhere to be found when we needed to collect our luggage. NO STAFF, NO HELP, just myself and some guests waiting for 20minutes to check in. Just like the soundproofing?athey vanish when you need them most.

What?£¦s most frustrating is that guests have been complaining about this for months, and the hotel keeps responding with the same EMPTY PROMISES about ?¨Frestful nights?ºô and ?¨Fongoing improvements.?ºô Nothing has changed. The only thing they seem to be working on is how to keep charging guests FULL PRICE FOR A SLEEPLESS NIGHT.

This isn?£¦t just a bad stay?ait?£¦s A FAILURE OF MANAGEMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY If Ascott wants to maintain its reputation, they need to stop ignoring feedbacks and start fixing. Fix the walls, fix the floors, fix the lies?aor stop charging people for a bed on the street.",0,0,0

For a bit of change in scenery, stay in a heritage shoplot converted to a guesthouse.  It has it charm and quaint-ness.

Pros
1.  Has a small shared kitchenette shared by all
2.  Outram Park MRT - 450 metres walk (nice view along the way).
3.  Plenty of higher end F&B outlets (+ a smattering of local eats) within 5 mins walk from the hotel
4.  Location is pretty good and close to Chinatown.  Very walkable and plenty of area to explore
5.  Heritage view just right out of the hotel entrance

Cons
1.  Rooms are rather smaller on the 2nd floor
2.  No bottled water in the room - you need to go to the kitchenette to refill glass jugs (guess walking is good exercise)
3.  Internet speed is rather slow-er (comparatively) vs other hotels (7.64 Mbps DL / 7.65 UL)
4.  Not all TV channels working.  Some of the channels freezes and you don't get any image.

Tips
1.  Book rooms on the 3rd floor with the skylight.  They are larger than the 2nd floor units
2.  Can hear faint music on rooms located on the 2nd floor.  This could be from the F&B on the ground floor (not part of the hotel)",0,0,0

Later, we felt the room lighting was too warm and wanted to replace it with a white woven lamp. We also wanted the kitchen gas stove ignition repaired. After we informed the hostess of our needs, she quickly communicated with her colleague, Mr. LSK (I don't know his full name), and the problem was solved quickly. Mr. LSK was very professional and responsible. He fixed the ceiling light very quickly and explained how to use the kitchen gas stove, repeatedly emphasizing that he was worried about burns. Regarding the lighting, the auntie even gave me a floor lamp, worried we weren't used to warm lights. She also brought me an electric fan in the kitchen, worried I'd get too hot while cooking. It was so thoughtful and heartwarming, and I felt a mother's care. Finally, the auntie brought me a lotus flower made by her colleague, Mee Choo, just for me. Thanks to their clever design, the center of the lotus flower can be used to hold jewelry (pictures below). They truly put the customer first and were incredibly thoughtful in every aspect. My roommate also told me that when he checked in, he noticed the makeup mirror at the end of his bed was reflecting onto the headboard (it's a custom in our hometown not to sleep facing a mirror). The next day, the staff came in and noticed he'd blocked the mirror with a pillow. They questioned him and then covered it up with stickers. Their attentiveness was truly remarkable. During my two-day stay, I felt completely safe and happy. The most homely detail was the fact that the hotel grows fresh vegetables, fruits, and potted plants, all provided free of charge. It was impeccable and I have nothing but praise for it. If the boss sees this review, I'd like to say, ""You're truly amazing! You've delivered such impeccable service at this hotel. You're truly lucky to have such wonderful staff."" So, I'd like to ask that if you see this review, please pass on my gratitude to your employee, Aunt Betty, for her thoughtful and attentive service. Thank you to Mr. LSK for his responsibility, which has made our lives more secure. Thank you to Mee Choo for his ingenuity. Their meticulousness and commitment have allowed us to experience the pinnacle of hotel service, down to the smallest details.",0,0,0

Resort hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,mohamedsR9026ZH,,157,,Raffles Sentosa Singapore,4.5,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at the newly opened Raffles Sentosa, which, according to staff, began welcoming guests in May 2025. Nestled in a serene enclave of Singapore?£¦s lush island, the property promises seclusion and tranquility. |In that respect, it certainly delivers, but there are no proper or interesting activities for young ones. However, for a brand so steeped in legendary hospitality, this particular incarnation appears to be in its embryonic phase, still finding its rhythm and certainly the service is sub-standard.|I booked the Presidential Villa for four nights, and it was undeniably modern and clean. The villa exudes potential. However, it was rather disappointing to discover that the private pool was not heated an unwelcomed omission for a villa of this category. Several other issues were also experienced, including, without limitation: one bath tub leaks even when plugged, the shower in one room had no hot water and this remained unfixed throughout the stay (despite attempts to fix it), and certain amenities were either missing or limited. Although the property is marketed as a resort sanctuary, there is no direct access to a beach, a reality that tempers the appeal of an otherwise idyllic setting. This limitation, combined with the absence of certain anticipated comforts, makes it clear that the resort may not yet be prepared to fully meet the expectations of high-end guests and the luxury affiliated with the Raffles name.|The most significant shortcoming of my stay, however, was the sub-standard service provided throughout. While many of the staff were courteous and well-meaning, it became evident that the property is clearly understaffed and further training of staff is certainly needed. Numerous service lapses marred what should have been a seamless experience. Response times were consistently slow, reception was difficult to reach and usually had one person only, and several of my requests were unfulfilled after extended delays. The butler team, typically the heart of luxury hospitality, seemed overwhelmed and unprepared to handle even basic inquiries. There was little initiative taken, and their role felt ornamental rather than functional. Even on the last day of my departure at 7:30 am in the morning, reception staff were not present and when I inquired, I was told that they were on the way, but no one arrived until I left, and so the checkout was done by other staff who assisted with the bags. |Most concerning, the sensor of the Villa doors kept malfunctioning and they had to try and fix this no less than three times in 4 days. I also discovered a screw in the villa?£¦s private pool ?a a safety hazard ?a that should have been avoided. While I was fortunate to have noticed it before any incident, such oversights are simply unacceptable at this level of hospitality.|Ironically, the most reliable and genuinely helpful member of the staff I encountered was the doorman (Mr. Singh), whose consistent courtesy and eagerness to assist stood in stark contrast to the general inattentiveness experienced elsewhere.|It is quite regrettable that in 4 days, I had to experience numerous mishaps and problems that made the whole stay unworthy. |In sum, Raffles Sentosa holds a promise of becoming a refined haven in Singapore's luxury landscape ?a the architectural canvas is there, the setting is calm, and the ambition is palpable. But as of now, that promise remains unfulfilled. The experience was, regrettably, more aspirational than exceptional. |At its current price point, the experience regrettably does not reflect the level of service one would reasonably expect. The disparity between cost and delivery renders the offering difficult to justify, falling short of the value typically associated with such a premium tier of hospitality. While the Presidential Villa is priced in the upper echelons of luxury accommodation, the overall experience, particularly in terms of service, does not correspond with the premium charged. What is even more disturbing is that when all these issues were reported, nothing really got better!  |For me, this was a one-time encounter; memorable, yes, but not in the way that invites repetition! Given the dissonance between promise and delivery, it is regrettable that I do not anticipate returning; some experiences are best left unrepeated.",0,0,0

Imagine our surprise to return to our villa at 3.50pm and notice cleaners equipment at our door, and more shockingly, to walk in and see one of the two cleaners sitting on the couch at the foot of our bed of our bed, playing with their phone!||We checked out at 7.15am on departure flight for our flight for Sri Lanka, so missed breakfast but they kindly arranged two takeaway coffees for us to take in the taxi. It was with dismay however to get a WhatsApp message (from a  butler on the same chat group where we'd arranged the 7.05am cart pick up and takeaway coffees) at 10.27am reminding us of breakfast time and suggesting the Crepes with Coconut Creme or fresh Waffles. ||We visited the in house spa on day 2 and could not fault the warm welcome, the facilities and Sarah my therapist.||We also used the communal pool one afternoon prior to sunset, and whilst we were offered water straight away, it took another 20 minutes to attract someones attention for a drinks menu and then a further 20 minutes to attract some one to take our actual drink order, partly because all the staff had gone inside to do a pre-service briefing. Having just handed us menus, it was rather strange, knowing we were clearly about to order a drink. There were no other guests at the pool or restaurant at this time. There seemed to be a lot of trainees at this F&B outlet too, hence the issues. Couldn't fault the manager and assistant managers though.||Japansese restaurant food was amazing, although we were given no verbal explanation on arrival as to what was to come. ie was it al a carte, or degustation etc. We just sat there and then started being served food. Again. Communication.||So overall we left  little disappointed that the service  wasn't up to par with the Raffles Singapore where we have stayed three times previously and not a patch on the two Aman properties we've just returned from in Sri Lanka.||Hopefully they can focus a little more on team training to bring it up to the standard you'd expect of somewhere charging the prices they do.",0,0,0
Resort hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,MZ Y K,42,157,2,Raffles Sentosa Singapore,4.5,"Just for context, I'm an accor gold member for a decade already. Honestly, I was so excited for raffles sentosa and have been waiting for months, booked the villa for birthday celebration this year, but I have to agree with the rest of the reviews that it fall short of the ""raffles"" brand name. Understand its new, and that the staff team are still familiarising with the processes etc, but some of the mistakes were really atrocious and unacceptable for a hotel standard.

The location is nice, but it's built on slopes, having to squeeze about 62 villas, restaurants etc, into a space right beside the existing sofitel sentosa, one can imagine how the slopes and spaces would be, the same pathway for people to walk on is the same pathway for buggy throughout the hotel, villa 10 was basically facing a restaurant, and the constant people, buggy, and sounds coming from the pathway just right outside the villa can be heard during the day. I can appreciate the vision and the way the hotel is set up to be a sanctuary, with the pool, separate living room and hotel room space, the way the property was built is thoughtful and beautiful indeed (but imagine bali pool side villa in a tight space).

And the amount of issues experienced from the hotel staff team, I was at empire grill for lunch, informed the staff team that I'm checking in to the hotel, but even after providing my full name to 3 diff staff, they couldn't get my villa number, and couldn't arrange for a buggy to send me straight to my villa after the lunch, I had to return to the hotel lobby before going to the villa (identification card had been provided at the point of my arrival before lunch). When the butler came and pick us up from the hotel lobby, one can understand how frustrating it already was for me (birthday celebration and it was drizzling), when I narrated my experience, the butler just brushed the matter off and did not attend to it (giving an eye to another trainee in the buggy, I'm in the buggy and could see the eye contact they had). When I ordered in room dining, the person left the room and buggy without closing the door. And despite me providing my drop off address in email before arrival, they couldn't find the details and tried asking me over phone, and then the third time over WhatsApp message.
And lastly even before checked out, the call was made to have a buggy sent to the villa, the person over the phone asked if I need help with luggage, I replied yes, the buggy came, and when I opened the door, no help was offered to help me with the luggage, I had to go inside the room and took all my bags out while the person stood outside the door waiting.
It's quite evident that their communications and processes must have failed from one team to another in the many examples given above. To be fair, the staff team are trying, but they are definitely not delivering the outcomes and experiences for a 5 star luxury hotel, and this is raffles brand we are talking about. I guess its not asking too much when we paid the price for the hotel brand name and somehow expect a decent service to be delivered?",0,0,0

We recently hosted a private wellness and sound healing event at Raffles Sentosa, and the entire experience exceeded all expectations.

Our evening started at Empire Grill, where both the indoor and outdoor spaces were elegantly set up for me and my 14 guests. The ambiance was stunning, and the food was beautifully prepared ?a a perfect setting to gather and connect before our session.

A heartfelt thank you to Mico, who was the key force behind it all. She managed every detail seamlessly ?a from coordinating the dinner setup to the spa logistics. Her professionalism, warmth, and care ensured that everything ran smoothly, allowing me and my community to feel fully supported. This event would not have been the same without her dedication ?a thank you, Mico!

We were also well taken care of by Santos, our F&B attendant, who was incredibly attentive and proactive throughout the dinner. The entire staff was gracious and welcoming.

After dinner, we transitioned into the newly renovated Raffles Spa, and it was absolutely divine. The moment we stepped inside, it no longer felt like we were in Singapore. The space was so tranquil and beautifully designed ?a from the sound of the waterfalls to the gentle rustling of the trees, everything contributed to a deep sense of serenity. The upgrade has truly made this one of the best spas in Singapore.

We were warmly welcomed into the spa by Ann, whose gracious greeting made the experience even more special.

Thank you again to the wonderful team at Raffles Sentosa for hosting us. It was a magical evening that left all of us feeling nourished, relaxed, and deeply grateful.",0,0,0

Resort hotel ,FALSE,TRUE,Daryl Lee,20,157,5,Raffles Sentosa Singapore,4.5,"Very well taken care of by the butlers and friendly staff on the ground. Staff were easily reachable via Whatsapp and was very prompt in delivering items to the villa or getting the buggy around. The garden villa was very nicely furnished with only the heavy sliding doors between the lounge and bedroom causing some frustration. Cleanliness wise, we spotted a used plaster left behind by the previous occupant on the patio but housekeeping quickly took care of it when I highlighted it.

The grounds were beautifully maintained with impeccable greenery amidst its rolling slopes. Activities were limited on a Saturday as most butler-led activities including bird watching were on weekdays and not on weekends. This was a pity.

Check-in was the least comfortable part as we had to wait quite a bit at the main lobby. The staff however were very helpful in helping us get to Royal China for a late lunch before completing the check-in at the villa. Likewise, the check out experience was great as they can do it at the villa. A friend we met during our stay did highlight that the same lobby was experiencing quite a packed situation during check out. Perhaps a more staggered approach would improve the experience for everyone?

If you're staying at a hotel on Sentosa Island, the Sentosa Express only requires a fee the first time. (Traveling within the island is free, but a fee applies from VivoCity onward.)
Therefore, if you take a screenshot of the QR code at the hotel, your return to VivoCity will be free.
There are four different pools. There's a lazy river, so bringing a swim ring might be a good idea. Pool towels are provided, so you don't need to take them with you.

We couldn't even take photos of our own for keepsake. $88 for 2 pictures and digital copies???? Was told that since we did not have a lot of pictures taken by their photographer (about 42, of which MANY WERE JUST REPEATED SNAPS OF THE SAME ""MOMENT"") they would give us a discount of $60, which to me, still isn't justified. You would expect the pictures to come out EXTRAORDINARY but honestly it's as basic as it can be. They didn't even have a list of the prices for the purchase of photos....suspicious..... I'd rather get charged an extra $5 for tickets and take my own pictures, free will. I think my pictures look better (beauty is in the eye of the beholder). We also got screamed at by one of the photographers bc we took 1 picture btw. 1 PICTURE. As if that one picture is gna melt all the ice........

We came at 4-5, 1h snowtime or wtv.... but the slides were closed at 4:45. NOWHERE DID IT STATE THAT SLIDES WERE CLOSING 15 MINS BEFORE CLOSING TIME (but correct me if i'm wrong). So we ended up paying for 45 mins instead of the whole hour. Double upset because not like we could take pictures in the remaining 15 mins because of the policy..........so we ended up leaving.

Don't even bother considering for the bumper car ride because it was truly underwhelming (for the thrillseeking adults). It could only move backwards?????? But to be fair, it was mainly for kids.

The only plus point was the slides and glacier luge because they were genuinely fun. However, that experience got cut short too.

This isn?£¦t just a ritual ?a it's a legacy started by our grandfather in the 1930s, carried on through the decades even after his passing in the 1960s. This is our family?£¦s heartfelt offering, a deeply rooted tradition, and spiritual continuity.

We were ready to carry our beautifully decorated Amman on a palanquin in a humble procession. That?£¦s when two men from the temple management approached us and demanded that all male members must wear a veshti (traditional Indian men?£¦s wear). When I respectfully questioned this rule, their response was aggressive and accusatory. We were told not to ""bring shame to the Indian community"" and to follow what others have ?¨Fobliged?ºô to.

Yes, we complied ?a not out of respect for the rule, but out of respect for the occasion. And yes, it was stated in the terms and conditions, which were conveniently brought up after full payment was made. But let?£¦s pause here and reflect.

My questions to the temple management and the wider Hindu community:

1. Which Hindu Puranam mandates veshti as compulsory for men attending or conducting religious rites?

2. Is our devotion now secondary to attire? Can a payment and legacy of nearly a century be overruled by a dress code clause?

3. Why was this never enforced by previous management, and why the sudden, forceful imposition now?

4. Are we heading towards a version of faith where coercion replaces connection? Is this what Indian culture in Singapore is becoming ?a dictated by terms instead of trust?

5. Who gave the temple management the moral authority to force attire upon devotees?

6. Isn?£¦t a temple meant to welcome prayers, not police them? When did we allow administrators to become enforcers of personal identity?

Let me be honest: I?£¦ve never liked wearing traditional clothes, and I rarely ever do. It has nothing to do with disrespect ?a it?£¦s just who I am. Faith should never be conditional on fabric. I left the temple today not with the peace I usually feel after our obayum, but with a heavy heart and bitter aftertaste.

This needs to stop.

Temple management is about stewardship, not dictatorship. You are there to facilitate devotion, not impose tradition. You are not the gatekeepers of our faith ?a the deity is.",0,0,0

Hotel ,FALSE,FALSE,Mark Grimes,10,341,4,The Quay Hotel West Coast,3.7,"You get what you pay for. This is one of the cheapest hotels in this area and Singapore is generally expensive. If you are thinking it is expensive in a general sense and should therefore be 4-star standard, please adjust your expectations.

I stayed in one of the cheapest, windowless rooms. The bed was clean, large and firm, I found it comfortable and more than acceptable. The bathroom was spacious and, if anything, the water pressure was too high and the water sometimes too hot! Service was very good. There was an iron and ironing board in the room, a kettle and pitcher was provided, with some basic tea / coffee supplies. There was a small desk that would just about be usable if you sat on the end of the bed.

The decor is, admittedly, poor in some places. Paint appears patchy and the lifts are quite old. There are things stacked in the corridors etc. The corridors were being renovated when I was staying, which was being done until 2200h and was occasionally disturbing. However, if you want a cheap room, I found it to be very clean, perhaps aside from some hair left in the shower drain that I noticed after I'd been there a few days.

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Booking and checking in/out was so easy, and during my stay all the staff were kind.

The location is great if you are attending NUS or INSEAD, which are close enough to commute. West Coast Park is quite nice but obviously the CBD and most major tourist areas are over the other side of the island. By taxi it might be USD 20-30 each way (or more in rush hour), so perhaps best to stay on the East Coast unless you have time to use the public transport.

The area felt safe, many tourists, schools and residential areas. There are many public transport connections stopping in the area to take you most major places. There is a 24h 7-11 close by and some vending machines outside the hotel. The 7-11 allows you to microwave food any that you bought there so you can get a cheap hot meal. The restaurants around the area are also well-known and recommended by locals, there is a real mix of cuisines and some are quite reasonably priced.

My one major issue was that there was a peephole in my door but no cover, so the light from the corridor would light the room enough to stop me sleeping, so I had to use an eye mask. Perhaps a sticky-note would have done the job.",0,0,0

We had a truly memorable stay at Equarius Hotel, Resorts World Sentosa from July 7 to July 10, 2025, and what made it truly special was the outstanding service from the entire staff, especially the Concierge team, the Tangerine restaurant staff, and Housekeeping.

We were a big group ?a five rooms booked with my cousins ?a and from the moment we arrived, the staff went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable and well taken care of.

It took me a little time to write this review as I had misplaced the paper where I wrote down all their names, but I didn?£¦t want to miss the chance to acknowledge everyone who made our stay so wonderful.

A special thank you to Ariel from the Concierge team. He assisted us on our first night, helped bring all our luggage to our rooms, and made sure everything went smoothly. On two separate nights, when we came back late after going out and the shuttle bus was no longer available, Ariel personally came to pick us up, making sure we got back to the hotel safely. His initiative, thoughtfulness, and professionalism truly stood out.

We would also like to thank the rest of the fantastic Concierge team: Cherryn, Kelly, Cliff, Chen Long, and especially Firdaus, who helped us during check-out. Firdaus singlehandedly handled all our group?£¦s luggage, and did it with calmness and efficiency ?a we were very impressed!

A big thank you as well to the two lovely and friendly ladies from Tangerine restaurant, Monette and Micah, who welcomed me and my son warmly every morning during breakfast. They were always kind, attentive, and made our mornings feel extra special. The ambience of the restaurant was beautiful, peaceful, and added to the overall relaxing experience.

Lastly, a heartfelt thanks to the Housekeeping staff who took care of our rooms during our stay. Although I unfortunately forgot their names, we truly appreciated how clean, fresh, and organized our rooms were every day. Their quiet hard work behind the scenes made a big difference.

The hotel itself is peaceful, spacious, and perfect for families or large groups visiting Sentosa ?a but what truly sets it apart is the genuine warmth and exceptional service of its staff.

Thank you again to everyone who made our stay unforgettable ?a we will always remember the kindness and hospitality we received.

We highly recommend Equarius Hotel for its peaceful atmosphere, spacious rooms, and most of all ?a its exceptional staff.

Room Tip: Ideal for families or large groups. Ask Concierge for help anytime ?a they are fantastic!

Resort hotel Hotel,FALSE,TRUE,Orange,890,1902,2,Equarius Hotel,4.3,"Our recent stay was a mixed bag, with a few thoughtful touches overshadowed by areas that sorely need attention.

The Good:
The highlight of the stay was definitely the complimentary in-room bar, which is refilled daily?aa generous and convenient feature. Guests also receive a QR code for free entry into Sentosa, whether arriving by car or tram. On top of that, there?£¦s a free shuttle service available from Michael and Ora hotels, which makes getting around a lot easier.

The Not-so-Good:
The hotel feels distinctly old-school, and unfortunately, not in a charming or nostalgic way. It?£¦s in desperate need of an upgrade to match the modern standards of the surrounding properties. Everything from the lobby to the pool area just feels sad, tired, and lacking in vibrancy.

Its location?atucked away at the far end of Sentosa?amakes it feel rather isolated. While that can be a plus for those seeking privacy, it also meant we were far from the island?£¦s main attractions and conveniences. On Saturday night, the noise from the Pink Dot event carried through the night, so light sleepers beware.

The pool experience was another major letdown. With no lifeguard, no music, no food or drinks, and not a single activity on offer, it lacked any kind of energy or resort atmosphere. Just a quiet, unattended space that didn?£¦t invite you to linger.

Cleanliness standards were also questionable. The cups in the room weren?£¦t properly cleaned, so we recommend checking all items before use.

Overall, while there are a few conveniences worth noting, the hotel seriously needs to modernize and inject some life into its offerings to keep up with Sentosa?£¦s vibrant and evolving hospitality scene.",0,0,0
